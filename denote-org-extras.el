Remove the subtree from its current file and move its contents into a

including subheadings).

Take the text of the subtree's top level heading and use it as the title
of the new note.

If the heading has any tags, use them as the keywords of the new note.
If the Org file has any #+filetags use them as well (Org's filetags are
inherited by the headings).  If none of these are true and the user
option `denote-prompts' includes an entry for keywords, then prompt for
keywords.  Else do not include any keywords.

If the heading has a PROPERTIES drawer, retain it for further review.

If the heading's PROPERTIES drawer includes a DATE or CREATED property,
or there exists a CLOSED statement with a timestamp value, use that to
derive the date (or date and time) of the new note (if there is only a
date, the time is taken as 00:00).  If more than one of these is
present, the order of preference is DATE, then CREATED, then CLOSED.  If
none of these is present, use the current time.  If the `denote-prompts'
includes an entry for a date, then prompt for a date at this stage (also
see `denote-date-prompt-use-org-read-date').

For the rest, consult the value of the user option `denote-prompts' in
the following scenaria:

- Optionally prompt for a subdirectory, otherwise produce the new note
  in the variable `denote-directory'.

- Optionally prompt for a file signature, otherwise do not use one.

`denote-file-type'."
