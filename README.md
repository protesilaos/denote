# denote: Simple notes with an efficient file-naming scheme

Denote is a simple note-taking tool for Emacs.  It is based on the idea
that notes should follow a predictable and descriptive file-naming
scheme.  The file name must offer a clear indication of what the note is
about, without reference to any other metadata.  Denote basically
streamlines the creation of such files while providing facilities to
link between them.
