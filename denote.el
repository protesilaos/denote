;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Denote aims to be a simple-to-use, focused-in-scope, and effective
;; note-taking tool for Emacs.  The manual describes all the
;; technicalities about the file-naming scheme, points of entry to
;; creating new notes, commands to check links between notes, and more:
;; <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote>.  If you have the info manual
;; available, evaluate:
;;
;;    (info "(denote) Top")
;;
;; What follows is a general overview of its core core design
;; principles (again: please read the manual for the technicalities):
;;
;; * Predictability :: File names must follow a consistent and
;;   descriptive naming convention (see the manual's "The file-naming
;;   scheme").  The file name alone should offer a clear indication of
;;   what the contents are, without reference to any other metadatum.
;;   This convention is not specific to note-taking, as it is pertinent
;;   to any form of file that is part of the user's long-term storage
;;   (see the manual's "Renaming files").
;;
;; * Composability :: Be a good Emacs citizen, by integrating with other
;;   packages or built-in functionality instead of re-inventing
;;   functions such as for filtering or greping.  The author of Denote
;;   (Protesilaos, aka "Prot") writes ordinary notes in plain text
;;   (`.txt'), switching on demand to an Org file only when its expanded
;;   set of functionality is required for the task at hand (see the
;;   manual's "Points of entry").
;;
;; * Portability :: Notes are plain text and should remain portable.
;;   The way Denote writes file names, the front matter it includes in
;;   the note's header, and the links it establishes must all be
;;   adequately usable with standard Unix tools.  No need for a databse
;;   or some specialised software.  As Denote develops and this manual
;;   is fully fleshed out, there will be concrete examples on how to do
;;   the Denote-equivalent on the command-line.
;;
;; * Flexibility :: Do not assume the user's preference for a
;;   note-taking methodology.  Denote is conceptually similar to the
;;   Zettelkasten Method, which you can learn more about in this
;;   detailed introduction: <https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/>.
;;   Notes are atomic (one file per note) and have a unique identifier.
;;   However, Denote does not enforce a particular methodology for
;;   knowledge management, such as a restricted vocabulary or mutually
;;   exclusive sets of keywords.  Denote also does not check if the user
;;   writes thematically atomic notes.  It is up to the user to apply
;;   the requisite rigor and/or creativity in pursuit of their preferred
;;   workflow (see the manual's "Writing metanotes").
;;
;; * Hackability :: Denote's code base consists of small and reusable
;;   functions.  They all have documentation strings.  The idea is to
;;   make it easier for users of varying levels of expertise to
;;   understand what is going on and make surgical interventions where
;;   necessary (e.g. to tweak some formatting).  In this manual, we
;;   provide concrete examples on such user-level configurations (see
;;   the manual's "Keep a journal or diary").
;;
;; Now the important part...  "Denote" is the familiar word, though it
;; also is a play on the "note" concept.  Plus, we can come up with
;; acronyms, recursive or otherwise, of increasingly dubious utility
;; like:
;;
;; + Don't Ever Note Only The Epiphenomenal
;; + Denote Everything Neatly; Omit The Excesses
;;
;; But we'll let you get back to work.  Don't Eschew or Neglect your
;; Obligations, Tasks, and Engagements.

  "Directory for storing personal notes.

A safe local value of either `default-directory' or `local' can
be added as a value in a .dir-local.el file.  Do this if you
intend to use multiple directory silos for your notes while still
relying on a global value (which is the value of this variable).
The Denote manual has a sample (search for '.dir-locals.el').
Those silos do not communicate with each other: they remain
separate.

The local value influences where commands such as `denote' will
place the newly created note.  If the command is called from a
directory or file where the local value exists, then that value
take precedence, otherwise the global value is used.

If you intend to reference this variable in Lisp, consider using
the function `denote-directory' instead: it returns the path as a
directory and also checks if a safe local value should be used."

  "Whether to infer keywords from existing notes' file names.

variable `denote-directory' for their keyword field and extract
the entries as \"inferred keywords\".  These are combined with
`denote-known-keywords' and are presented as completion
candidates while using `denote' and related commands
interactively.

If nil, refrain from inferring keywords.  The aforementioned
completion prompt only shows the `denote-known-keywords'.  Use
this if you want to enforce a restricted vocabulary.

Inferred keywords are specific to the value of the variable
`denote-directory'.  If a silo with a local value is used, as
explained in that variable's doc string, the inferred keywords
are specific to the given silo.

For advanced Lisp usage, the function `denote-keywords' returns
the appropriate list of strings."

(defcustom denote-prompts '(title keywords)
  "Specify the prompts of the `denote' command for interactive use.

The value is a list of symbols, which includes any of the following:

- `title': Prompt for the title of the new note.

- `keywords': Prompts with completion for the keywords of the new
  note.  Available candidates are those specified in the user
  option `denote-known-keywords'.  If the user option
  `denote-infer-keywords' is non-nil, keywords in existing note
  file names are included in the list of candidates.  The
  `keywords' prompt uses `completing-read-multiple', meaning that
  it can accept multiple keywords separated by a comma (or
  whatever the value of `crm-separator' is).

- `file-type': Prompts with completion for the file type of the
  new note.  Available candidates are those specified in the user
  option `denote-file-type'.  Without this prompt, `denote' uses
  the value of `denote-file-type'.

- `subdirectory': Prompts with completion for a subdirectory in
  which to create the note.  Available candidates are the value
  of the user option `denote-directory' and all of its
  subdirectories.  Any subdirectory must already exist: Denote
  will not create it.

- `date': Prompts for the date of the new note.  It will expect
  an input like 2022-06-16 or a date plus time: 2022-06-16 14:30.
  Without the `date' prompt, the `denote' command uses the
  `current-time'.

- `template': Prompts for a KEY among `denote-templates'.  The
  value of that KEY is used to populate the new note with
  content, which is added after the front matter.

The prompts occur in the given order.

If the value of this user option is nil, no prompts are used.
The resulting file name will consist of an identifier (i.e. the
date and time) and a supported file type extension (per
`denote-file-type').

Recall that Denote's standard file-naming scheme is defined as
follows (read the manual for the technicalities):

    DATE--TITLE__KEYWORDS.EXT

If either or both of the `title' and `keywords' prompts are not
included in the value of this variable, file names will be any of
those permutations:

    DATE.EXT
    DATE--TITLE.EXT
    DATE__KEYWORDS.EXT

When in doubt, always include the `title' and `keywords' prompts.

Finally, this user option only affects the interactive use of the
`denote' command (advanced users can call it from Lisp).  For
ad-hoc interactive actions that do not change the default
behaviour of the `denote' command, users can invoke these
convenience commands: `denote-type', `denote-subdirectory',
`denote-date'."

(defun denote-rename-file (file title keywords)
  "Rename file and update existing front matter if appropriate.

If in Dired, consider FILE to be the one at point, else prompt
with minibuffer completion for one.

If FILE has a Denote-compliant identifier, retain it while
updating the TITLE and KEYWORDS fields of the file name.  Else
create an identifier based on the file's attribute of last
modification time.  If such attribute cannot be found, the
identifier falls back to the `current-time'.

The default TITLE is retrieved from a line starting with a title
field in the file's contents, depending on the given file
type (e.g. #+title for Org).  Else, the file name is used as a
default value at the minibuffer prompt.

As a final step after the FILE, TITLE, and KEYWORDS prompts, ask
for confirmation, showing the difference between old and new file
names.

The file type extension (like .txt) is read from the underlying
file and is preserved through the renaming process.  Files that
have no extension are simply left without one.

Renaming only occurs relative to the current directory.  Files
are not moved between directories.

If the FILE has Denote-style front matter for the TITLE and
KEYWORDS, ask to rewrite their values in order to reflect the new
input (this step always requires confirmation and the underlying
buffer is not saved, so consider invoking `diff-buffer-with-file'
to double-check the effect).  The rewrite of the FILE and
KEYWORDS in the front matter should not affect the rest of the
block.

If the file doesn't have front matter but is among the supported
file types (per `denote-file-type'), add front matter at the top
of it and leave the buffer unsaved for further inspection.

For per-file-type front matter, refer to the variables:

- `denote-org-front-matter'
- `denote-text-front-matter'
- `denote-toml-front-matter'
- `denote-yaml-front-matter'

This command is intended to (i) rename existing Denote notes
while updating their title and keywords in the front matter, (ii)
convert existing supported file types to Denote notes, and (ii)
rename non-note files (e.g. PDF) that can benefit from Denote's
file-naming scheme.  The latter is a convenience we provide,
since we already have all the requisite mechanisms in
place (though Denote does not---and will not---manage such
files)."
