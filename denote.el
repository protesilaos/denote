;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Denote aims to be a simple-to-use, focused-in-scope, and effective
;; note-taking tool for Emacs.  The manual describes all the
;; technicalities about the file-naming scheme, points of entry to
;; creating new notes, commands to check links between notes, and more:
;; <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote>.  If you have the info manual
;; available, evaluate:
;;
;;    (info "(denote) Top")
;;
;; What follows is a general overview of its core core design
;; principles:
;;
;; * Predictability :: File names must follow a consistent and
;;   descriptive naming convention (see the manual's "The file-naming
;;   scheme").  The file name alone should offer a clear indication of
;;   what the contents are, without reference to any other metadatum.
;;   This convention is not specific to note-taking, as it is pertinent
;;   to any form of file that is part of the user's long-term storage
;;   (see the manual's "Renaming files").
;;
;; * Composability :: Be a good Emacs citizen, by integrating with other
;;   packages or built-in functionality instead of re-inventing
;;   functions such as for filtering or greping.  The author of Denote
;;   (Protesilaos, aka "Prot") writes ordinary notes in plain text
;;   (`.txt'), switching on demand to an Org file only when its expanded
;;   set of functionality is required for the task at hand (see the
;;   manual's "Points of entry").
;;
;; * Portability :: Notes are plain text and should remain portable.
;;   The way Denote writes file names, the front matter it includes in
;;   the note's header, and the links it establishes must all be
;;   adequately usable with standard Unix tools.  No need for a databse
;;   or some specialised software.  As Denote develops and this manual
;;   is fully fleshed out, there will be concrete examples on how to do
;;   the Denote-equivalent on the command-line.
;;
;; * Flexibility :: Do not assume the user's preference for a
;;   note-taking methodology.  Denote is conceptually similar to the
;;   Zettelkasten Method, which you can learn more about in this
;;   detailed introduction: <https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/>.
;;   Notes are atomic (one file per note) and have a unique identifier.
;;   However, Denote does not enforce a particular methodology for
;;   knowledge management, such as a restricted vocabulary or mutually
;;   exclusive sets of keywords.  Denote also does not check if the user
;;   writes thematically atomic notes.  It is up to the user to apply
;;   the requisite rigor and/or creativity in pursuit of their preferred
;;   workflow (see the manual's "Writing metanotes").
;;
;; * Hackability :: Denote's code base consists of small and reusable
;;   functions.  They all have documentation strings.  The idea is to
;;   make it easier for users of varying levels of expertise to
;;   understand what is going on and make surgical interventions where
;;   necessary (e.g. to tweak some formatting).  In this manual, we
;;   provide concrete examples on such user-level configurations (see
;;   the manual's "Keep a journal or diary").
;;
;; Now the important part...  "Denote" is the familiar word, though it
;; also is a play on the "note" concept.  Plus, we can come up with
;; acronyms, recursive or otherwise, of increasingly dubious utility
;; like:
;;
;; + Don't Ever Note Only The Epiphenomenal
;; + Denote Everything Neatly; Omit The Excesses
;;
;; But we'll let you get back to work.  Don't Eschew or Neglect your
;; Obligations, Tasks, and Engagements.

relying on a global value (which is the value of this variable).
The Denote manual has a sample (search for '.dir-locals.el').
Those silos do not communicate with each other: they remain
separate.

The local value influences where commands such as `denote' will
place the newly created note.  If the command is called from a
directory or file where the local value exists, then that value
take precedence, otherwise the global value is used.

If you intend to reference this variable in Lisp, consider using
