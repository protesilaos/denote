;;; Commentary:

;; Denote aims to be a simple-to-use, focused-in-scope, and effective
;; note-taking and file-naming tool for Emacs.
;;
;; Denote is based on the idea that files should follow a predictable
;; and descriptive file-naming scheme.  The file name must offer a
;; clear indication of what the contents are about, without reference
;; to any other metadata.  Denote basically streamlines the creation
;; of such files or file names while providing facilities to link
;; between them (where those files are editable).
;;
;; Denote's file-naming scheme is not limited to "notes".  It can be used
;; for all types of file, including those that are not editable in Emacs,
;; such as videos.  Naming files in a consistent way makes their
;; filtering and retrieval considerably easier.  Denote provides relevant
;; facilities to rename files, regardless of file type.
;;
;; The manual describes all the technicalities about the file-naming
;; scheme, points of entry to creating new notes, commands to check
;; links between notes, and more: ;; <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote>.
;; If you have the info manual available, evaluate:
;;
;;    (info "(denote) Top")
;;
;; What follows is a general overview of its core core design
;; principles (again: please read the manual for the technicalities):
;;
;; * Predictability :: File names must follow a consistent and
;;   descriptive naming convention (see the manual's "The file-naming
;;   scheme").  The file name alone should offer a clear indication of
;;   what the contents are, without reference to any other metadatum.
;;   This convention is not specific to note-taking, as it is pertinent
;;   to any form of file that is part of the user's long-term storage
;;   (see the manual's "Renaming files").
;;
;; * Composability :: Be a good Emacs citizen, by integrating with other
;;   packages or built-in functionality instead of re-inventing
;;   functions such as for filtering or greping.  The author of Denote
;;   (Protesilaos, aka "Prot") writes ordinary notes in plain text
;;   (`.txt'), switching on demand to an Org file only when its expanded
;;   set of functionality is required for the task at hand (see the
;;   manual's "Points of entry").
;;
;; * Portability :: Notes are plain text and should remain portable.
;;   The way Denote writes file names, the front matter it includes in
;;   the note's header, and the links it establishes must all be
;;   adequately usable with standard Unix tools.  No need for a databse
;;   or some specialised software.  As Denote develops and this manual
;;   is fully fleshed out, there will be concrete examples on how to do
;;   the Denote-equivalent on the command-line.
;;
;; * Flexibility :: Do not assume the user's preference for a
;;   note-taking methodology.  Denote is conceptually similar to the
;;   Zettelkasten Method, which you can learn more about in this
;;   detailed introduction: <https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/>.
;;   Notes are atomic (one file per note) and have a unique identifier.
;;   However, Denote does not enforce a particular methodology for
;;   knowledge management, such as a restricted vocabulary or mutually
;;   exclusive sets of keywords.  Denote also does not check if the user
;;   writes thematically atomic notes.  It is up to the user to apply
;;   the requisite rigor and/or creativity in pursuit of their preferred
;;   workflow (see the manual's "Writing metanotes").
;;
;; * Hackability :: Denote's code base consists of small and reusable
;;   functions.  They all have documentation strings.  The idea is to
;;   make it easier for users of varying levels of expertise to
;;   understand what is going on and make surgical interventions where
;;   necessary (e.g. to tweak some formatting).  In this manual, we
;;   provide concrete examples on such user-level configurations (see
;;   the manual's "Keep a journal or diary").
;;
;; Now the important part...  "Denote" is the familiar word, though it
;; also is a play on the "note" concept.  Plus, we can come up with
;; acronyms, recursive or otherwise, of increasingly dubious utility
;; like:
;;
;; + Don't Ever Note Only The Epiphenomenal
;; + Denote Everything Neatly; Omit The Excesses
;;
;; But we'll let you get back to work.  Don't Eschew or Neglect your
;; Obligations, Tasks, and Engagements.

(defcustom denote-prompts '(title keywords)
  "Specify the prompts followed by relevant Denote commands.

Commands that prompt for user input to construct a Denote file name
include, but are not limited to: `denote', `denote-signature',
`denote-type', `denote-date', `denote-subdirectory',
`denote-rename-file', `denote-dired-rename-files'.

The value of this user option is a list of symbols, which includes any
of the following:

- `title': Prompt for the title of the new note.

- `keywords': Prompts with completion for the keywords of the new
  note.  Available candidates are those specified in the user
  option `denote-known-keywords'.  If the user option
  `denote-infer-keywords' is non-nil, keywords in existing note
  file names are included in the list of candidates.  The
  `keywords' prompt uses `completing-read-multiple', meaning that
  it can accept multiple keywords separated by a comma (or
  whatever the value of `crm-separator' is).

- `file-type': Prompts with completion for the file type of the
  new note.  Available candidates are those specified in the user
  option `denote-file-type'.  Without this prompt, `denote' uses
  the value of the variable `denote-file-type'.

- `subdirectory': Prompts with completion for a subdirectory in
  which to create the note.  Available candidates are the value
  of the user option `denote-directory' and all of its
  subdirectories.  Any subdirectory must already exist: Denote
  will not create it.

- `date': Prompts for the date of the new note.  It will expect
  an input like 2022-06-16 or a date plus time: 2022-06-16 14:30.
  Without the `date' prompt, the `denote' command uses the
  `current-time'.  (To leverage the more sophisticated Org
  method, see the `denote-date-prompt-use-org-read-date'.)

- `template': Prompts for a KEY among `denote-templates'.  The
  value of that KEY is used to populate the new note with
  content, which is added after the front matter.

- `signature': Prompts for an arbitrary string that can be used
  to qualify the note according to the user's methodology.
  Signatures have no strictly defined function and are up to the
  user to apply as they see fit.  One use-case is to implement
  Niklas Luhmann's Zettelkasten system for a sequence of notes
  (Folgezettel).  Signatures are not included in a file's front
  matter.  They are reserved solely for creating a structure in a
  file listing.  To insert a link that includes the signature,
  use the command `denote-link-with-signature'.

The prompts occur in the given order.

If the value of this user option is nil, no prompts are used.  The
resulting file name will consist of an identifier (i.e. the date and
time) and a supported file type extension (per the variable
`denote-file-type').

Recall that Denote's standard file-naming scheme is defined as
follows (read the manual for the technicalities):

    DATE--TITLE__KEYWORDS.EXT

Depending on the inclusion of the `title', `keywords', and
`signature' prompts, file names will be any of those
permutations:

    DATE.EXT
    DATE--TITLE.EXT
    DATE__KEYWORDS.EXT
    DATE==SIGNATURE.EXT
    DATE==SIGNATURE--TITLE.EXT
    DATE==SIGNATURE--TITLE__KEYWORDS.EXT
    DATE==SIGNATURE__KEYWORDS.EXT

When in doubt, always include the `title' and `keywords'
prompts (the default style).

Finally, this user option only affects the interactive use of the
`denote' or other relevant commands (advanced users can call it from
Lisp).  In Lisp usage, the behaviour is always what the caller
specifies, based on the supplied arguments.

Also see `denote-history-completion-in-prompts'.

`denote-file-name-components-order'."

(defcustom denote-file-name-components-order '(identifier signature title keywords)
  "Specify the order of the file name components.

The value is a list of the following symbols:

- `identifier': This is the combination of the date and time.  When it
  is the first on the list, it looks like \"20240519T073456\" and does
  not have a component separator of its own due its unambiguous format.
  When it is placed anywhere else in the file name, it is prefixed with
  \"@@\", so it looks like \"@@20240519T073456\".

- `signature': This is an arbitrary string that can be used to qualify
  the file in some way, according to the user's methodology (e.g. to add
  a sequence to notes).  The string is always prefixed with the \"==\"
  to remain unambiguous.

- `title': This is an arbitrary string which describes the file.  It is
  always prefixed with \"--\" to be unambiguous.

- `keywords': This is a series of one or more words that succinctly
  group the file.  Multiple keywords are separated by an underscore
  prefixed to each of them.  The file name component is always prefixed
  with \"__\".

All four symbols must appear exactly once.  Duplicates are ignored.  Any
missing symbol is added automatically.

Some examples:

    (setq denote-file-name-components-order
       \\='(identifier signature title keywords))
    => 20240519T07345==hello--this-is-the-title__denote_testing.org

    => --this-is-the-title==hello@@20240519T07345__denote_testing.org

       \\='(keywords title signature identifier))
    => __denote_testing--this-is-the-title==hello@@20240519T07345.org

Also see the user option `denote-prompts', which affects which
components are actually used in the order specified herein.

Before deciding on this, please consider the longer-term implications
of file names with varying patterns. Consistency makes things
predictable and thus easier to find. So pick one order and never touch
it again. When in doubt, leave the default file-naming scheme as-is."

  actually insert it, use the command `org-insert-link'.  Note that
  `org-capture' uses `org-store-link' internally when it needs to store
  a link.  ]

When the value is nil, the Denote handler for `org-store-link' produces
links only to the current file (by using the file's identifier).  For
example:

    [[denote:20240118T060608][Some test]]

This is what Denote was doing in versions prior to 2.3.0.

If the value is `context', the link consists of the file's identifier
and the text of the current heading, like this:

    [[denote:20240118T060608::*Heading text][Some test::Heading text]].

However, if there already exists a CUSTOM_ID property for the current
heading, this is always given priority and is used instead of the
context.

If the value is `id' or, for backward-compatibility, any other non-nil
value, then Denote will use the standard Org mechanism of the CUSTOM_ID
property to create a unique link to the heading.  If the heading does
not have a CUSTOM_ID, it creates it and includes it in its PROPERTIES
drawer.  If a CUSTOM_ID exists, it takes it as-is.  The result is like
this:

    [[denote:20240118T060608::#h:eed0fb8e-4cc7-478f][Some test::Heading text]]

The value of the CUSTOM_ID is determined by the Org user option
`org-id-method'.  The sample shown above uses the default UUID
infrastructure (though I deleted a few characters to not get
complaints from the byte compiler about long lines in the doc
string...).

Note that this option does not affect how Org behaves with regard to
`org-id-link-to-org-use-id'.  If that user option is set to create ID
properties, then those will be created by Org even if the Denote link
handler will take care to not use/store the ID value.  Concretely, users
who never want ID properties under their headings should keep
`org-id-link-to-org-use-id' in its nil value.

Context links are easier to break than those with a CUSTOM_ID in cases
where either the heading text changes or there is another heading that
matches that text.  The potential advantage of context links is that
they do not require a PROPERTIES drawer.

When visiting a link to a heading, Org opens the Denote file and then
navigates to that heading.

[ This feature only works in Org mode files, as other file types
  do not have a linking mechanism that handles unique identifiers
  for headings or other patterns to jump to.  If `org-store-link'
  is invoked in one such file, it captures only the Denote
  identifier of the file, even if this user option is set to a

- The METHOD is the function to be used to format the given

is called with one argument, the file, and should return a string
representing the link description.

The default is a function that returns the active region or the title of
the note (with the signature if present).

If the value is a string, it treats specially the following specifiers:

- The %t is the Denote TITLE in the front matter or the file name.
- The %T is the Denote TITLE in the file name.
- The %i is the Denote IDENTIFIER of the file.
- The %d is the same as %i (DATE mnemonic).
- The %s is the Denote SIGNATURE of the file.
- The %k is the Denote KEYWORDS of the file.
- The %% is a literal percent sign.

In addition, the following flags are available for each of the specifiers:

- 0 :: Pad to the width, if given, with zeros instead of spaces.
- - :: Pad to the width, if given, on the right instead of the left.
- < :: Truncate to the width and precision, if given, on the left.
- > :: Truncate to the width and precision, if given, on the right.
- ^ :: Convert to upper case.
- _ :: Convert to lower case.

  "Alist of variable `denote-file-type' and their format properties.

Each element is of the form (SYMBOL PROPERTY-LIST).  SYMBOL is one of
those specified in the user option `denote-file-type' or an arbitrary
symbol that defines a new file type.

PROPERTY-LIST is a plist that consists of the following elements:

- `:extension' is a string with the file extension including the
  period.

- `:date-function' is a function that can format a date.  See the
  functions `denote-date-iso-8601', `denote-date-rfc3339', and
  `denote-date-org-timestamp'.

- `:front-matter' is either a string passed to `format' or a
  variable holding such a string.  The `format' function accepts
  four arguments, which come from `denote' in this order: TITLE,
  DATE, KEYWORDS, IDENTIFIER.  Read the doc string of `format' on
  how to reorder arguments.

- `:title-key-regexp' is a regular expression that is used to
  retrieve the title line in a file.  The first line matching
  this regexp is considered the title line.

- `:title-value-function' is the function used to format the raw
  title string for inclusion in the front matter (e.g. to
  surround it with quotes).  Use the `identity' function if no
  further processing is required.

- `:title-value-reverse-function' is the function used to
  retrieve the raw title string from the front matter.  It
  performs the reverse of `:title-value-function'.

- `:keywords-key-regexp' is a regular expression used to retrieve
  the keywords' line in the file.  The first line matching this
  regexp is considered the keywords' line.

- `:keywords-value-function' is the function used to format the
  keywords' list of strings as a single string, with appropriate
  delimiters, for inclusion in the front matter.

- `:keywords-value-reverse-function' is the function used to
  retrieve the keywords' value from the front matter.  It
  performs the reverse of the `:keywords-value-function'.

- `:link' is a string, or variable holding a string, that
  specifies the format of a link.  See the variables
  `denote-org-link-format', `denote-md-link-format'.

- `:link-in-context-regexp' is a regular expression that is used
  to match the aforementioned link format.  See the variables
  `denote-org-link-in-context-regexp',`denote-md-link-in-context-regexp'.

If the user option `denote-file-type' is nil, use the first element of
this list for new note creation.  The default is `org'.")

(defun denote-rename-file (file title keywords signature date)
  "Rename file and update existing front matter if appropriate.

Always rename the file where it is located in the file system:
never move it to another directory.

If in Dired, consider FILE to be the one at point, else the
current file, else prompt with minibuffer completion for one.
When called from Lisp, FILE is a file system path represented as
a string.

If FILE has a Denote-compliant identifier, retain it while
updating components of the file name referenced by the user
option `denote-prompts'.  By default, these are the TITLE and
KEYWORDS.  The SIGNATURE is another one.  When called from Lisp,
TITLE and SIGNATURE are strings, while KEYWORDS is a list of
strings.

If there is no identifier, create an identifier based on the
following conditions:

1. If the `denote-prompts' includes an entry for date prompts,
   then prompt for DATE and take its input to produce a new
   identifier.  For use in Lisp, DATE must conform with
   `denote-valid-date-p'.

2. If DATE is nil (e.g. when `denote-prompts' does not include a
   date entry), use the file attributes to determine the last
   modified date of FILE and format it as an identifier.

3. As a fallback, derive an identifier from the current date and
   time.

4. At any rate, if the resulting identifier is not unique among
   the files in the variable `denote-directory', increment it
   such that it becomes unique.

In interactive use, and assuming `denote-prompts' includes a
title entry, make the TITLE prompt have prefilled text in the
minibuffer that consists of the current title of FILE.  The
current title is either retrieved from the front matter (such as
the #+title in Org) or from the file name.

Do the same for the SIGNATURE prompt, subject to `denote-prompts',
by prefilling the minibuffer with the current signature of FILE,
if any.

Same principle for the KEYWORDS prompt: convert the keywords in
the file name into a comma-separated string and prefill the
minibuffer with it (the KEYWORDS prompt accepts more than one
keywords, each separated by a comma, else the `crm-separator').

For all prompts, interpret an empty input as an instruction to
remove that file name component.  For example, if a TITLE prompt
is available and FILE is 20240211T093531--some-title__keyword1.org
then rename FILE to 20240211T093531__keyword1.org.

In interactive use, if there is no entry for a file name
component in `denote-prompts', keep it as-is.

When called from Lisp, the special symbol `keep-current' can be
used for the TITLE, KEYWORDS, SIGNATURE and DATE parameters to
keep them as-is.

[ NOTE: Please check with your minibuffer user interface how to
  provide an empty input.  The Emacs default setup accepts the
  empty minibuffer contents as they are, though popular packages
  like `vertico' use the first available completion candidate
  instead.  For `vertico', the user must either move one up to
  select the prompt and then type RET there with empty contents,
  or use the command `vertico-exit-input' with empty contents.
  That Vertico command is bound to M-RET as of this writing on
  2024-02-13 08:08 +0200. ]

As a final step, ask for confirmation, showing the difference
between old and new file names.  Do not ask for confirmation if
the user option `denote-rename-confirmations' does not contain
the symbol `modify-file-name'.

If FILE has front matter for TITLE and KEYWORDS, ask to rewrite
their values in order to reflect the new input, unless
`denote-rename-confirmations' lacks `rewrite-front-matter'.  When
the `denote-save-buffers' is nil (the default), do not save the
underlying buffer, thus giving the user the option to
double-check the result, such as by invoking the command
`diff-buffer-with-file'.  The rewrite of the TITLE and KEYWORDS
in the front matter should not affect the rest of the front
matter.

If the file does not have front matter but is among the supported file
types (per the user option `denote-file-type'), add front matter to the
top of it and leave the buffer unsaved for further inspection.  Save the
buffer if `denote-save-buffers' is non-nil.

When `denote-kill-buffers' is t or `on-rename', kill the buffer
if it was not already being visited before the rename operation.

For the front matter of each file type, refer to the variables:

- `denote-org-front-matter'
- `denote-text-front-matter'
- `denote-toml-front-matter'
- `denote-yaml-front-matter'

Construct the file name in accordance with the user option
`denote-file-name-components-order'.

Run the `denote-after-rename-file-hook' after renaming FILE.

This command is intended to (i) rename Denote files, (ii) convert
existing supported file types to Denote notes, and (ii) rename
non-note files (e.g. PDF) that can benefit from Denote's
file-naming scheme.

For a version of this command that works with multiple files
one-by-one, use `denote-dired-rename-files'."

  "Rename FILE using its front matter as input.
When called interactively, FILE is the variable `buffer-file-name' or
the Dired file at point, which is subsequently inspected for the
requisite front matter.  It is thus implied that the FILE has a file
type that is supported by Denote, per the user option `denote-file-type'.

The values of `denote-rename-confirmations',
`denote-save-buffers' and `denote-kill-buffers' are respected.

Only the front matter lines that appear in the front matter template (as
defined in `denote-file-types') will be handled.

To change the identifier (date) of the note with this command, the
identifier line (if present) of the front matter must be modified.
Modifying the date line has no effect.

While this command generally does not modify the front matter, there are
exceptions.  The value of the `date' line will follow that of the
`identifier' line.  If they are both in the front matter template and
the `date' line is missing, it will be added again.  Similarly, if they
are both in the front matter template and the `date' line is present and
the `identifier' line has been removed, the `date' line will be removed
as well.  Also, if the keywords are out of order and
`denote-sort-keywords' is non-nil, they will be sorted.  There will be a
prompt for this if `denote-rename-confirmations' contains
`rewrite-front-matter'.
