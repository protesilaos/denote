;;; Commentary:

;; Denote aims to be a simple-to-use, focused-in-scope, and effective
;; note-taking and file-naming tool for Emacs.
;;
;; Denote is based on the idea that files should follow a predictable
;; and descriptive file-naming scheme.  The file name must offer a
;; clear indication of what the contents are about, without reference
;; to any other metadata.  Denote basically streamlines the creation
;; of such files or file names while providing facilities to link
;; between them (where those files are editable).
;;
;; Denote's file-naming scheme is not limited to "notes".  It can be used
;; for all types of file, including those that are not editable in Emacs,
;; such as videos.  Naming files in a consistent way makes their
;; filtering and retrieval considerably easier.  Denote provides relevant
;; facilities to rename files, regardless of file type.
;;
;; The manual describes all the technicalities about the file-naming
;; scheme, points of entry to creating new notes, commands to check
;; links between notes, and more: ;; <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote>.
;; If you have the info manual available, evaluate:
;;
;;    (info "(denote) Top")
;;
;; What follows is a general overview of its core core design
;; principles (again: please read the manual for the technicalities):
;;
;; * Predictability :: File names must follow a consistent and
;;   descriptive naming convention (see the manual's "The file-naming
;;   scheme").  The file name alone should offer a clear indication of
;;   what the contents are, without reference to any other metadatum.
;;   This convention is not specific to note-taking, as it is pertinent
;;   to any form of file that is part of the user's long-term storage
;;   (see the manual's "Renaming files").
;;
;; * Composability :: Be a good Emacs citizen, by integrating with other
;;   packages or built-in functionality instead of re-inventing
;;   functions such as for filtering or greping.  The author of Denote
;;   (Protesilaos, aka "Prot") writes ordinary notes in plain text
;;   (`.txt'), switching on demand to an Org file only when its expanded
;;   set of functionality is required for the task at hand (see the
;;   manual's "Points of entry").
;;
;; * Portability :: Notes are plain text and should remain portable.
;;   The way Denote writes file names, the front matter it includes in
;;   the note's header, and the links it establishes must all be
;;   adequately usable with standard Unix tools.  No need for a databse
;;   or some specialised software.  As Denote develops and this manual
;;   is fully fleshed out, there will be concrete examples on how to do
;;   the Denote-equivalent on the command-line.
;;
;; * Flexibility :: Do not assume the user's preference for a
;;   note-taking methodology.  Denote is conceptually similar to the
;;   Zettelkasten Method, which you can learn more about in this
;;   detailed introduction: <https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/>.
;;   Notes are atomic (one file per note) and have a unique identifier.
;;   However, Denote does not enforce a particular methodology for
;;   knowledge management, such as a restricted vocabulary or mutually
;;   exclusive sets of keywords.  Denote also does not check if the user
;;   writes thematically atomic notes.  It is up to the user to apply
;;   the requisite rigor and/or creativity in pursuit of their preferred
;;   workflow (see the manual's "Writing metanotes").
;;
;; * Hackability :: Denote's code base consists of small and reusable
;;   functions.  They all have documentation strings.  The idea is to
;;   make it easier for users of varying levels of expertise to
;;   understand what is going on and make surgical interventions where
;;   necessary (e.g. to tweak some formatting).  In this manual, we
;;   provide concrete examples on such user-level configurations (see
;;   the manual's "Keep a journal or diary").
;;
;; Now the important part...  "Denote" is the familiar word, though it
;; also is a play on the "note" concept.  Plus, we can come up with
;; acronyms, recursive or otherwise, of increasingly dubious utility
;; like:
;;
;; + Don't Ever Note Only The Epiphenomenal
;; + Denote Everything Neatly; Omit The Excesses
;;
;; But we'll let you get back to work.  Don't Eschew or Neglect your
;; Obligations, Tasks, and Engagements.

  "Directory for storing personal notes.

A safe local value of either `default-directory' or `local' can
be added as a value in a .dir-local.el file.  Do this if you
intend to use multiple directory silos for your notes while still
relying on a global value (which is the value of this variable).
The Denote manual has a sample (search for '.dir-locals.el').
Those silos do not communicate with each other: they remain
separate.

The local value influences where commands such as `denote' will
place the newly created note.  If the command is called from a
directory or file where the local value exists, then that value
take precedence, otherwise the global value is used.

If you intend to reference this variable in Lisp, consider using
the function `denote-directory' instead: it returns the path as a
directory and also checks if a safe local value should be used."

`denote-known-keywords' and are presented as completion
candidates while using `denote' and related commands
interactively.

If nil, refrain from inferring keywords.  The aforementioned
completion prompt only shows the `denote-known-keywords'.  Use
this if you want to enforce a restricted vocabulary.

The user option `denote-excluded-keywords-regexp' can be used to
exclude keywords that match a regular expression.

Inferred keywords are specific to the value of the variable
`denote-directory'.  If a silo with a local value is used, as
explained in that variable's doc string, the inferred keywords
are specific to the given silo.

For advanced Lisp usage, the function `denote-keywords' returns
the appropriate list of strings."
  :group 'denote
  :package-version '(denote . "0.1.0")
  :type 'boolean)

(defcustom denote-prompts '(title keywords)
  "Specify the prompts of the `denote' command for interactive use.

The value is a list of symbols, which includes any of the following:

- `title': Prompt for the title of the new note.

- `keywords': Prompts with completion for the keywords of the new
  note.  Available candidates are those specified in the user
  option `denote-known-keywords'.  If the user option
  `denote-infer-keywords' is non-nil, keywords in existing note
  file names are included in the list of candidates.  The
  `keywords' prompt uses `completing-read-multiple', meaning that
  it can accept multiple keywords separated by a comma (or
  whatever the value of `crm-separator' is).

- `file-type': Prompts with completion for the file type of the
  new note.  Available candidates are those specified in the user
  option `denote-file-type'.  Without this prompt, `denote' uses
  the value of `denote-file-type'.

- `subdirectory': Prompts with completion for a subdirectory in
  which to create the note.  Available candidates are the value
  of the user option `denote-directory' and all of its
  subdirectories.  Any subdirectory must already exist: Denote
  will not create it.

- `date': Prompts for the date of the new note.  It will expect
  an input like 2022-06-16 or a date plus time: 2022-06-16 14:30.
  Without the `date' prompt, the `denote' command uses the
  `current-time'.  (To leverage the more sophisticated Org
  method, see the `denote-date-prompt-use-org-read-date'.)

- `template': Prompts for a KEY among `denote-templates'.  The
  value of that KEY is used to populate the new note with
  content, which is added after the front matter.

- `signature': Prompts for an arbitrary string that can be used
  to establish a sequential relationship between files (e.g. 1,
  1a, 1b, 1b1, 1b2, ...).  Signatures have no strictly defined
  function and are up to the user to apply as they see fit.  One
  use-case is to implement Niklas Luhmann's Zettelkasten system
  for a sequence of notes (Folgezettel).  Signatures are not
  included in a file's front matter.  They are reserved solely
  for creating a sequence in a file listing, at least for the
  time being.  To insert a link that includes the signature, use
  the command `denote-link-with-signature'.

The prompts occur in the given order.

If the value of this user option is nil, no prompts are used.
The resulting file name will consist of an identifier (i.e. the
date and time) and a supported file type extension (per
`denote-file-type').

Recall that Denote's standard file-naming scheme is defined as
follows (read the manual for the technicalities):

    DATE--TITLE__KEYWORDS.EXT

Depending on the inclusion of the `title', `keywords', and
`signature' prompts, file names will be any of those
permutations:

    DATE.EXT
    DATE--TITLE.EXT
    DATE__KEYWORDS.EXT
    DATE==SIGNATURE.EXT
    DATE==SIGNATURE--TITLE.EXT
    DATE==SIGNATURE--TITLE__KEYWORDS.EXT
    DATE==SIGNATURE__KEYWORDS.EXT

When in doubt, always include the `title' and `keywords'
prompts (the default style).

Finally, this user option only affects the interactive use of the
`denote' command (advanced users can call it from Lisp).  For
ad-hoc interactive actions that do not change the default
behaviour of the `denote' command, users can invoke these
convenience commands: `denote-type', `denote-subdirectory',
`denote-date', `denote-template', `denote-signature'."

  The `downcase' METHOD converts user input for the given

  `denote-date-org-timestamp'.

- `:front-matter' is either a string passed to `format' or a
  variable holding such a string.  The `format' function accepts
  four arguments, which come from `denote' in this order: TITLE,
  DATE, KEYWORDS, IDENTIFIER.  Read the doc string of `format' on
  how to reorder arguments.

- `:title-key-regexp' is a regular expression that is used to
  retrieve the title line in a file.  The first line matching
  this regexp is considered the title line.

- `:title-value-function' is the function used to format the raw
  title string for inclusion in the front matter (e.g. to
  surround it with quotes).  Use the `identity' function if no
  further processing is required.

- `:title-value-reverse-function' is the function used to
  retrieve the raw title string from the front matter.  It
  performs the reverse of `:title-value-function'.

- `:keywords-key-regexp' is a regular expression used to retrieve
  the keywords' line in the file.  The first line matching this
  regexp is considered the keywords' line.

- `:keywords-value-function' is the function used to format the
  keywords' list of strings as a single string, with appropriate
  delimiters, for inclusion in the front matter.

- `:keywords-value-reverse-function' is the function used to
  retrieve the keywords' value from the front matter.  It
  performs the reverse of the `:keywords-value-function'.

- `:link' is a string, or variable holding a string, that
  specifies the format of a link.  See the variables
  `denote-org-link-format', `denote-md-link-format'.

- `:link-in-context-regexp' is a regular expression that is used
  to match the aforementioned link format.  See the variables
  `denote-org-link-in-context-regexp',`denote-md-link-in-context-regexp'.

If `denote-file-type' is nil, use the first element of this list
for new note creation.  The default is `org'.")

(defun denote-rename-file (file title keywords signature &optional ask-date)
  "Rename file and update existing front matter if appropriate.

If in Dired, consider FILE to be the one at point, else prompt
with minibuffer completion for one.  When called from Lisp, FILE
is a filesystem path represented as a string.

If FILE has a Denote-compliant identifier, retain it while
updating the TITLE, KEYWORDS, and SIGNATURE components of the
file name.

Else create an identifier based on the following conditions:

1. If optional ASK-DATE is non-nil (such as with a prefix
   argument), prompt for a date and use it to derive the
   identifier.

2. If optional ASK-DATE is nil (this is the case without a prefix
   argument), use the file attributes to determine the last
   modified date and format it as an identifier.

3. As a fallback, derive an identifier from the current time.

4. If the resulting identifier is not unique among the files in
   the variable `denote-directory', increment it such that it
   becomes unique.

Add TITLE to FILE.  In interactive use, prompt for user input and
retrieve the default TITLE value from a line starting with a
title field in the file's contents, depending on the given file
type (e.g. #+title for Org).  Else, use the file name as a
default value at the minibuffer prompt.  When called from Lisp,
TITLE is a string.

If TITLE is nil or an empty string, do not add it to a newly
renamed file or remove it from an existing file.

Add SIGNATURE to FILE.  In interactive use, prompt for SIGNATURE,
using an existing one as the default value at the minibuffer
prompt.  When called from Lisp, SIGNATURE is a string.

If SIGNATURE is nil or an empty string, do not add it to a newly
renamed file or remove it from an existing file.

Add KEYWORDS to FILE.  In interactive use, prompt for KEYWORDS.
More than one keyword can be inserted when separated by the
`crm-sepator' (normally a comma).  When called from Lisp,
KEYWORDS is a list of strings.

If KEYWORDS is nil or an empty string, do not add it to a newly
renamed file or remove it from an existing file.

Read the file type extension (like .txt) from the underlying file
and preserve it through the renaming process.  Files that have no
extension are left without one.

Renaming only occurs relative to the current directory.  Files
are not moved between directories.

As a final step after the FILE, TITLE, KEYWORDS, and SIGNATURE
are collected, ask for confirmation, showing the difference
between old and new file names.  Do not ask for confirmation if
the user option `denote-rename-no-confirm' is set to a non-nil
value.

If the FILE has Denote-style front matter for the TITLE and
KEYWORDS, ask to rewrite their values in order to reflect the new
input (this step always requires confirmation and the underlying
buffer is not saved, so consider invoking `diff-buffer-with-file'
to double-check the effect).  The rewrite of the TITLE and
KEYWORDS in the front matter should not affect the rest of the
front matter.

If the file does not have front matter but is among the supported
file types (per `denote-file-type'), add front matter at the top
of it and leave the buffer unsaved for further inspection.

For the front matter of each file type, refer to the variables:

- `denote-org-front-matter'
- `denote-text-front-matter'
- `denote-toml-front-matter'
- `denote-yaml-front-matter'

This command is intended to (i) rename existing Denote notes
while updating their title and keywords in the front matter, (ii)
convert existing supported file types to Denote notes, and (ii)
rename non-note files (e.g. PDF) that can benefit from Denote's
file-naming scheme."

of a property name and its value being a cons cell; thus a module
is written in either the following forms:

    NAME (HOOK . FUNCTION\)
    NAME (FUNCTION . FUNCTION\)

NAME, HOOK, FUNCTION are symbols.

When a HOOK-FUNCTION pair is used, `denote-modules-enable'
function will add FUNCTION to HOOK and `denote-modules-disable'
function will remove FUNCTION from HOOK.  Generally, it should be
possible to set HOOK-FUNCTION modules locally.

When a FUNCTION-FUNCTION pair is used, the first FUNCTION must be
an enable function and the second, its corresponding disable
function to undo the former.  They are both called with no
arguments.  For FUNCTION-FUNCTION modules, in some cases, it may
not be possible to enable a module locally.  In these cases, some
parts of a module may be enabled globally even when local minor
mode function `denote-modules-mode' is called.

before these enable/disable functions)")
