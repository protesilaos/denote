;;; Commentary:
;;
;; The `denote-link' command inserts a link at point to an entry specified
;; at the minibuffer prompt.  Links are formatted depending on the file
;; type of current note.  In Org and plain text buffers, links are
;; formatted thus: `[[denote:IDENTIFIER][TITLE]]'.  While in Markdown they
;; are expressed as `[TITLE](denote:IDENTIFIER)'.
;;
;; When `denote-link' is called with a prefix argument (`C-u' by default)
;; it formats links like `[[denote:IDENTIFIER]]'.  The user might prefer
;; its simplicity.
;;
;; When the user option `denote-link-use-org-id' is set to non-nil (default
;; is nil), inserted links in Org notes that target other Org notes will
;; use the standard `id:' type so the format is `[[id:IDENTIFIER][TITLE]]'
;; (the title is omitted is `denote-link' is called with a prefix argument,
;; as explained above).  When, however, an Org note links to a note in
;; another file, the link with use our own `denote:' type as there is no
;; standard for this case.
;;
;; Inserted links are automatically buttonized and remain active for as
;; long as the buffer is available.  In Org this is handled automatically
;; as Denote either uses the standard `id:' link type or creates its own
;; custom hyperlink: the `denote:' type which works exactly like the
;; `file:'.  In Markdown and plain text, Denote handles the buttonization
;; of those links.
;;
;; To buttonize links in existing files while visiting them, the user must
;; add this snippet to their setup:
;;
;;     (add-hook 'find-file-hook #'denote-link-buttonize-buffer)
;;
;; Denote has a major-mode-agnostic mechanism to collect all linked file
;; references in the current buffer and return them as an appropriately
;; formatted list.  This list can then be used in interactive commands.
;; The `denote-link-find-file' is such a command.  It uses minibuffer
;; completion to visit a file that is linked to from the current note.
;; The candidates have the correct metadata, which is ideal for
;; integration with other standards-compliant tools (see the manual's
;; "Extending Denote").  For instance, a package such as `marginalia'
;; will display accurate annotations, while the `embark' package will be
;; able to work its magic such as in exporting the list into a filtered
;; Dired buffer (i.e. a familiar Dired listing with only the files of
;; the current minibuffer session).
;;
;; The command `denote-link-backlinks' produces a bespoke buffer which
;; displays the file name of all notes linking to the current one.  Each
;; file name appears on its own line and is buttonized so that it performs
;; the action of visiting the referenced file.  The backlinks' buffer looks
;; like this:
;;
;;     Backlinks to "On being honest" (20220614T130812)
;;     ------------------------------------------------
;;
;;     20220614T145606--let-this-glance-become-a-stare__journal.txt
;;     20220616T182958--not-feeling-butterflies-in-your-stomach__journal.txt
;;
;; The backlinks' buffer is fontified by default, though the user has
;; access to the `denote-link-fontify-backlinks' option to disable this
;; effect by setting its value to nil.
;;
;; The placement of the backlinks' buffer is subject to the user option
;; `denote-link-backlinks-display-buffer-action'.  Due to the nature of the
;; underlying `display-buffer' mechanism, this inevitably is an advanced
;; feature.  By default, the backlinks' buffer is displayed below the
;; current window.  The doc string of our user option includes a
;; configuration that places the buffer in a left side window instead.
;; Reproducing it here for your convenience:
;;
;;     (setq denote-link-backlinks-display-buffer-action
;;           '((display-buffer-reuse-window
;;              display-buffer-in-side-window)
;;             (side . left)
;;             (slot . 99)
;;             (window-width . 0.3)))
;;
;; The command `denote-link-add-links' adds links at point matching a
;; regular expression or plain string.  The links are inserted as a
;; typographic list, such as:
;;
;;     - link1
;;     - link2
;;     - link3
;;
;; Each link is formatted according to the file type of the current note,
;; as explained further above about the `denote-link' command.  The current
;; note is excluded from the matching entries (adding a link to itself is
;; pointless).
;;
;; When called with a prefix argument (`C-u') `denote-link-add-links' will
;; format all links as `[[TYPE:IDENTIFIER]]', hence a typographic list:
;;
;;     - [[TYPE:IDENTIFIER-1]]
;;     - [[TYPE:IDENTIFIER-2]]
;;     - [[TYPE:IDENTIFIER-3]]
;;
;; The `TYPE' is either `denote:' or `id:', exactly as we explained above
;; for the `denote-link' command.
;;
;; Same examples of a regular expression that can be used with this
;; command:
;;
;; - `journal' match all files which include `journal' anywhere in their
;;   name.
;;
;; - `_journal' match all files which include `journal' as a keyword.
;;
;; - `^2022.*_journal' match all file names starting with `2022' and
;;   including the keyword `journal'.
;;
;; - `\.txt' match all files including `.txt'.  In practical terms, this
;;   only applies to the file extension, as Denote automatically removes
;;   dots (and other characters) from the base file name.
;;
;; If files are created with `denote-sort-keywords' as non-nil (the
;; default), then it is easy to write a regexp that includes multiple
;; keywords in alphabetic order:
;;
;; - `_denote.*_package' match all files that include both the `denote' and
;;   `package' keywords, in this order.
;;
;; - `\(.*denote.*package.*\)\|\(.*package.*denote.*\)' is the same as
;;   above, but out-of-order.
;;
;; Remember that regexp constructs only need to be escaped once (like `\|')
;; when done interactively but twice when called from Lisp.  What we show
;; above is for interactive usage.
;;
;; For convenience, the `denote-link' command has an alias called
;; `denote-link-insert-link'.  The `denote-link-backlinks' can also be used
;; as `denote-link-show-backlinks-buffer'.  While `denote-link-add-links'
;; is aliased `denote-link-insert-links-matching-regexp'.  The purpose of
;; these aliases is to offer alternative, more descriptive names of select
;; commands.
