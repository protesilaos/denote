* Overview
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:a09b70a2-ae0b-4855-ac14-1dddfc8e3241
:END:

Denote aims to be a simple-to-use, focused-in-scope, and effective
note-taking tool for Emacs.  It is based on the following core design
principles:

+ Predictability :: File names must follow a consistent and descriptive
  naming convention ([[#h:4e9c7512-84dc-4dfb-9fa9-e15d51178e5d][The file-naming scheme]]).  The file name alone
  should offer a clear indication of what the contents are, without
  reference to any other metadatum.  This convention is not specific to
  note-taking, as it is pertinent to any form of file that is part of
  the user's long-term storage ([[#h:532e8e2a-9b7d-41c0-8f4b-3c5cbb7d4dca][Renaming files]]).

+ Composability :: Be a good Emacs citizen, by integrating with other
  packages or built-in functionality instead of re-inventing functions
  such as for filtering or greping.  The author of Denote (Protesilaos,
  aka "Prot") writes ordinary notes in plain text (=.txt=), switching on
  demand to an Org file only when its expanded set of functionality is
  required for the task at hand ([[#h:17896c8c-d97a-4faa-abf6-31df99746ca6][Points of entry]]).

+ Portability :: Notes are plain text and should remain portable.  The
  way Denote writes file names, the front matter it includes in the
  note's header, and the links it establishes must all be adequately
  usable with standard Unix tools.  No need for a database or some
  specialised software.  As Denote develops and this manual is fully
  fleshed out, there will be concrete examples on how to do the
  Denote-equivalent on the command-line.

+ Flexibility :: Do not assume the user's preference for a note-taking
  methodology.  Denote is conceptually similar to the Zettelkasten
  Method, which you can learn more about in this detailed introduction:
  <https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/>.  Notes are atomic (one file
  per note) and have a unique identifier.  However, Denote does not
  enforce a particular methodology for knowledge management, such as a
  restricted vocabulary or mutually exclusive sets of keywords.  Denote
  also does not check if the user writes thematically atomic notes.  It
  is up to the user to apply the requisite rigor and/or creativity in
  pursuit of their preferred workflow ([[#h:6060a7e6-f179-4d42-a9de-a9968aaebecc][Writing metanotes]]).

+ Hackability :: Denote's code base consists of small and reusable
  functions.  They all have documentation strings.  The idea is to make
  it easier for users of varying levels of expertise to understand what
  is going on and make surgical interventions where necessary (e.g. to
  tweak some formatting).  In this manual, we provide concrete examples
  on such user-level configurations ([[#h:4a6d92dd-19eb-4fcc-a7b5-05ce04da3a92][Keep a journal or diary]]).

Now the important part...  "Denote" is the familiar word, though it also
is a play on the "note" concept.  Plus, we can come up with acronyms,
recursive or otherwise, of increasingly dubious utility like:

+ Don't Ever Note Only The Epiphenomenal
+ Denote Everything Neatly; Omit The Excesses

But we'll let you get back to work.  Don't Eschew or Neglect your
Obligations, Tasks, and Engagements.

#+findex: denote
#+findex: denote-type
#+findex: denote-org-capture
#+findex: denote-date
#+findex: denote-subdirectory
#+findex: denote-template
There are five ways to write a note with Denote: invoke the ~denote~,
~denote-type~, ~denote-date~, ~denote-subdirectory~, ~denote-template~
commands, or leverage the ~org-capture-templates~ by setting up a
template which calls the function ~denote-org-capture~.  We explain all
of those in the subsequent sections.

** Standard note creation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:6a92a8b5-d766-42cc-8e5b-8dc255466a23
:END:

[ The region as default title is part of {{{development-version}}} ]

The ~denote~ command will prompt for a title.  If a region is active,
the text of the region becomes the default at the minibuffer prompt
(meaning that typing =RET= without any input will use the default
value).  Once the title is supplied, the ~denote~ command will then ask
for keywords.  The resulting note will have a file name as already
explained: [[#h:4e9c7512-84dc-4dfb-9fa9-e15d51178e5d][The file naming scheme]]

The file type of the new note is determined by the user option
~denote-file-type~ ([[#h:13218826-56a5-482a-9b91-5b6de4f14261][Front matter]]).

#+vindex: denote-known-keywords
#+vindex: denote-infer-keywords
The keywords' prompt supports minibuffer completion.  Available
candidates are those defined in the user option ~denote-known-keywords~.
More candidates can be inferred from the names of existing notes, by
setting ~denote-infer-keywords~ to non-nil (which is the case by
default).

#+vindex: denote-sort-keywords
Multiple keywords can be inserted by separating them with a comma (or
whatever the value of the ~crm-separator~ is---which should be a comma).
When the user option ~denote-sort-keywords~ is non-nil (the default),
keywords are sorted alphabetically (technically, the sorting is done
with ~string-lessp~).

The interactive behaviour of the ~denote~ command is influenced by the
user option ~denote-prompts~ ([[#h:f9204f1f-fcee-49b1-8081-16a08a338099][The denote-prompts option]]).

The ~denote~ command can also be called from Lisp.  Read its doc string
for the technicalities.

#+findex: denote-create-note
In the interest of discoverability, ~denote~ is also available under the
alias ~denote-create-note~.

*** The ~denote-prompts~ option
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:f9204f1f-fcee-49b1-8081-16a08a338099
:END:

#+vindex: denote-prompts
The user option ~denote-prompts~ determines how the ~denote~ command
will behave interactively ([[#h:6a92a8b5-d766-42cc-8e5b-8dc255466a23][Standard note creation]]).

The value is a list of symbols, which includes any of the following:

- =title=: Prompt for the title of the new note.

- =keywords=: Prompts with completion for the keywords of the new note.
  Available candidates are those specified in the user option
  ~denote-known-keywords~.  If the user option ~denote-infer-keywords~
  is non-nil, keywords in existing note file names are included in the
  list of candidates.  The =keywords= prompt uses
  ~completing-read-multiple~, meaning that it can accept multiple
  keywords separated by a comma (or whatever the value of ~crm-sepator~
  is).

- =file-type=: Prompts with completion for the file type of the new
  note.  Available candidates are those specified in the user option
  ~denote-file-type~.  Without this prompt, ~denote~ uses the value of
  ~denote-file-type~.

- =subdirectory=: Prompts with completion for a subdirectory in which to
  create the note.  Available candidates are the value of the user
  option ~denote-directory~ and all of its subdirectories.  Any
  subdirectory must already exist: Denote will not create it.

- =date=: Prompts for the date of the new note.  It will expect an input
  like 2022-06-16 or a date plus time: 2022-06-16 14:30.  Without the
  =date= prompt, the ~denote~ command uses the ~current-time~.

  [[#h:e7ef08d6-af1b-4ab3-bb00-494a653e6d63][The denote-date-prompt-use-org-read-date option]].

- =template=: Prompts for a KEY among the ~denote-templates~.  The value
  of that KEY is used to populate the new note with content, which is
  added after the front matter ([[#h:f635a490-d29e-4608-9372-7bd13b34d56c][The denote-templates option]]).

The prompts occur in the given order.

If the value of this user option is nil, no prompts are used.  The
resulting file name will consist of an identifier (i.e. the date and
time) and a supported file type extension (per ~denote-file-type~).

Recall that Denote's standard file-naming scheme is defined as follows
([[#h:4e9c7512-84dc-4dfb-9fa9-e15d51178e5d][The file-naming scheme]]):

: DATE--TITLE__KEYWORDS.EXT

If either or both of the =title= and =keywords= prompts are not
included in the value of this variable, file names will be any of
those permutations:

: DATE.EXT
: DATE--TITLE.EXT
: DATE__KEYWORDS.EXT

When in doubt, always include the =title= and =keywords= prompts.

Finally, this user option only affects the interactive use of the
~denote~ command (advanced users can call it from Lisp).  For ad-hoc
interactive actions that do not change the default behaviour of the
~denote~ command, users can invoke these convenience commands:
~denote-type~, ~denote-subdirectory~, ~denote-date~.  They are described
in the subsequent section ([[#h:887bdced-9686-4e80-906f-789e407f2e8f][Convenience commands for note creation]]).

*** The ~denote-templates~ option
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:f635a490-d29e-4608-9372-7bd13b34d56c
:END:

#+vindex: denote-templates
The user option ~denote-templates~ is an alist of content templates for
new notes.  A template is arbitrary text that Denote will add to a newly
created note right below the front matter.

Templates are expressed as a =(KEY . STRING)= association.

- The =KEY= is the name which identifies the template.  It is an
  arbitrary symbol, such as =report=, =memo=, =statement=.

- The =STRING= is ordinary text that Denote will insert as-is.  It can
  contain newline characters to add spacing.  Below we show some
  concrete examples.

The user can choose a template either by invoking the command
~denote-template~ or by changing the user option ~denote-prompts~ to
always prompt for a template when calling the ~denote~ command.

[[#h:f9204f1f-fcee-49b1-8081-16a08a338099][The denote-prompts option]].

[[#h:887bdced-9686-4e80-906f-789e407f2e8f][Convenience commands for note creation]].

Templates can be written directly as one large string.  For example (the
=\n= character is read as a newline):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq denote-templates
      '((report . "* Some heading\n\n* Another heading")
        (memo . "* Some heading

,* Another heading

")))
#+end_src

Long strings may be easier to type but interpret indentation literally.
Also, they do not scale well.  A better way is to use some Elisp code to
construct the string.  This would typically be the ~concat~ function,
which joins multiple strings into one.  The following is the same as the
previous example:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq denote-templates
      `((report . "* Some heading\n\n* Another heading")
        (memo . ,(concat "* Some heading"
                         "\n\n"
                         "* Another heading"
                         "\n\n"))))
#+end_src

Notice that to evaluate a function inside of an alist we use the
backtick to quote the alist (NOT the straight quote) and then prepend a
comma to the expression that should be evaluated.  The ~concat~ form
here is not sensitive to indentation, so it is easier to adjust for
legibility.

DEV NOTE: We do not provide more examples at this point, though feel
welcome to ask for help if the information provided herein is not
sufficient.  We shall expand the manual accordingly.

*** Convenience commands for note creation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:887bdced-9686-4e80-906f-789e407f2e8f
:END:

Sometimes the user needs to create a note that has different
requirements from those of ~denote~ ([[#h:6a92a8b5-d766-42cc-8e5b-8dc255466a23][Standard note creation]]).  While
this can be achieved globally by changing the ~denote-prompts~ user
option, there are cases where an ad-hoc method is the appropriate one
([[#h:f9204f1f-fcee-49b1-8081-16a08a338099][The denote-prompts option]]).

To this end, Denote provides the following convenience interactive
commands for note creation:

+ Create note by specifying file type :: The ~denote-type~ command
  creates a note while prompting for a file type.

  This is the equivalent to calling ~denote~ when ~denote-prompts~ is
  set to ='(file-type title keywords)=.  In practical terms, this lets
  you produce, say, a note in Markdown even though you normally write in
  Org ([[#h:6a92a8b5-d766-42cc-8e5b-8dc255466a23][Standard note creation]]).

  #+findex: denote-create-note-using-type
  The ~denote-create-note-using-type~ is an alias of ~denote-type~.

+ Create note using a date :: Normally, Denote reads the current date
  and time to construct the unique identifier of a newly created note
  ([[#h:6a92a8b5-d766-42cc-8e5b-8dc255466a23][Standard note creation]]).  Sometimes, however, the user needs to set
  an explicit date+time value.

  This is where the ~denote-date~ command comes in.  It creates a note
  while prompting for a date.  The date can be in YEAR-MONTH-DAY
  notation like =2022-06-30= or that plus the time: =2022-06-16 14:30=.

  [[#h:e7ef08d6-af1b-4ab3-bb00-494a653e6d63][The denote-date-prompt-use-org-read-date option]].

  This is the equivalent to calling ~denote~ when ~denote-prompts~ is
  set to ='(date title keywords)=.

  #+findex: denote-create-note-using-date
  The ~denote-create-note-using-date~ is an alias of ~denote-date~.

+ Create note in a specific directory :: The ~denote-subdirectory~
  command creates a note while prompting for a subdirectory.  Available
  candidates include the value of the variable ~denote-directory~ and
  any subdirectory thereof (Denote does not create subdirectories).

  This is equivalent to calling ~denote~ when ~denote-prompts~ is set to
  ='(subdirectory title keywords)=.

  #+findex: denote-create-note-in-subdirectory
  The ~denote-create-note-in-subdirectory~ is a more descriptive alias
  of ~denote-subdirectory~.

+ Create note and add a template :: The ~denote-template~ command
  creates a new note and inserts the specified template below the front
  matter ([[#h:f635a490-d29e-4608-9372-7bd13b34d56c][The denote-templates option]]).  Available candidates for
  templates are specified in the user option ~denote-templates~.

  This is equivalent to calling ~denote~ when ~denote-prompts~ is
  set to ='(template title keywords)=.

  #+findex: denote-create-note-with-template
  The ~denote-create-note-with-template~ is an alias of the command
  ~denote-template~, meant to help with discoverability.

**** Write your own convenience commands
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:11946562-7eb0-4925-a3b5-92d75f1f5895
:END:

The convenience commands we provide only cover some basic use-cases
([[#h:887bdced-9686-4e80-906f-789e407f2e8f][Convenience commands for note creation]]).  The user may require
combinations that are not covered, such as to prompt for a template and
for a subdirectory, instead of only one of the two.  To this end, we
show how to follow the code we use in Denote to write your own variants
of those commands.

First let's take a look at the definition of one of those commands.
They all look the same, but we use ~denote-subdirectory~ for this
example:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun denote-subdirectory ()
  "Create note while prompting for a subdirectory.

Available candidates include the value of the variable
`denote-directory' and any subdirectory thereof.

This is equivalent to calling `denote' when `denote-prompts' is
set to '(subdirectory title keywords)."
  (declare (interactive-only t))
  (interactive)
  (let ((denote-prompts '(subdirectory title keywords)))
    (call-interactively #'denote)))
#+end_src

The hyphenated word after ~defun~ is the name of the function.  It has
to be unique.  Then we have the documentation string (or "doc string")
which is for the user's convenience.

This function is ~interactive~, meaning that it can be called via =M-x=
or be assigned to a key binding.  Then we have the local binding of the
~denote-prompts~ to the desired combination ("local" means specific to
this function without affecting other contexts).  Lastly, it calls the
standard ~denote~ command interactively, so it uses all the prompts in
their specified order.

Now let's say we want to have a command that (i) asks for a template and
(ii) for a subdirectory ([[#h:f635a490-d29e-4608-9372-7bd13b34d56c][The denote-templates option]]).  All we need to
do is tweak the ~let~ bound value of ~denote-prompts~ and give our
command a unique name:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Like `denote-subdirectory' but also ask for a template
(defun denote-subdirectory-with-template ()
  "Create note while also prompting for a template and subdirectory.

This is equivalent to calling `denote' when `denote-prompts' is
set to '(template subdirectory title keywords)."
  (declare (interactive-only t))
  (interactive)
  (let ((denote-prompts '(template subdirectory title keywords)))
    (call-interactively #'denote)))
#+end_src

The tweaks to ~denote-prompts~ determine how the command will behave
([[#h:f9204f1f-fcee-49b1-8081-16a08a338099][The denote-prompts option]]).  Use this paradigm to write your own
variants which you can then assign to keys or invoke with =M-x=.

*** The ~denote-date-prompt-use-org-read-date~ option
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:e7ef08d6-af1b-4ab3-bb00-494a653e6d63
:END:

[ Part of {{{development-version}}} ]

By default, Denote uses its own simple prompt for date or date+time
input ([[#h:f9204f1f-fcee-49b1-8081-16a08a338099][The denote-prompts option]]).  This is done when the
~denote-prompts~ option includes a =date= symbol and/or when the user
invokes the ~denote-date~ command.

#+vindex: denote-date-prompt-use-org-read-date
Users who want to benefit from the more advanced date selection method
that is common in interactions with Org mode, can set the user option
~denote-date-prompt-use-org-read-date~ to a non-nil value.

** Create note using Org capture
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:656c70cd-cf9a-4471-a0b5-4f0aaf60f881
:END:

For integration with ~org-capture~, the user must first add the relevant
template.  Such as:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'org-capture
  (add-to-list 'org-capture-templates
               '("n" "New note (with Denote)" plain
                 (file denote-last-path)
                 #'denote-org-capture
                 :no-save t
                 :immediate-finish nil
                 :kill-buffer t
                 :jump-to-captured t)))
#+end_src

[ In the future, we might develop Denote in ways which do not require such
  manual intervention.  More user feedback is required to identify the
  relevant workflows. ]

Once the template is added, it is accessed from the specified key.  If,
for instance, ~org-capture~ is bound to =C-c c=, then the note creation
is initiated with =C-c c n=, per the above snippet.  After that, the
process is the same as with invoking ~denote~ directly, namely: a prompt
for a title followed by a prompt for keywords ([[#h:6a92a8b5-d766-42cc-8e5b-8dc255466a23][Standard note creation]]).

#+vindex: denote-org-capture-specifiers
Users may prefer to leverage ~org-capture~ in order to extend file
creation with the specifiers described in the ~org-capture-templates~
documentation (such as to capture the active region and/or create a
hyperlink pointing to the given context).

IMPORTANT.  Due to the particular file-naming scheme of Denote, which is
derived dynamically, such specifiers or other arbitrary text cannot be
written directly in the template.  Instead, they have to be assigned to
the user option ~denote-org-capture-specifiers~, which is interpreted by
the function ~denote-org-capture~.  Example with our default value:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq denote-org-capture-specifiers "%l\n%i\n%?")
#+end_src

Note that ~denote-org-capture~ ignores the ~denote-file-type~: it always
sets the Org file extension for the created note to ensure that the
capture process works as intended, especially for the desired output of
the ~denote-org-capture-specifiers~.

** Maintain separate directories for notes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:15719799-a5ff-4e9a-9f10-4ca03ef8f6c5
:END:
#+cindex: Note silos

The user option ~denote-directory~ accepts a value that represents the
path to a directory, such as =~/Documents/notes=.  Normally, the user
will have one place where they store all their notes, in which case this
arrangement shall suffice.

There is, however, the possibility to maintain separate directories of
notes.  By "separate", we mean that they do not communicate with each
other: no linking between them, no common keywords, nothing.  Think of
the scenario where one set of notes is for private use and another is
for an employer.  We call these separate directories "silos".

To create silos, the user must specify a local variable at the root of
the desired directory.  This is done by creating a =.dir-locals.el=
file, with the following contents:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;;; Directory Local Variables.  For more information evaluate:
;;;
;;;     (info "(emacs) Directory Variables")

((nil . ((denote-directory . default-directory))))
#+end_src

When inside the directory that contains this =.dir-locals.el= file, all
Denote commands/functions for note creation, linking, the inference of
available keywords, et cetera will use the silo as their point of
reference.  They will not read the global value of ~denote-directory~.
The global value of ~denote-directory~ is read everywhere else except
the silos.

* Renaming files
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:532e8e2a-9b7d-41c0-8f4b-3c5cbb7d4dca
:END:

Denote provides commands to rename files and update their front matter
where relevant.  For Denote to work, only the file name needs to be in
order, by following our naming conventions ([[#h:4e9c7512-84dc-4dfb-9fa9-e15d51178e5d][The file-naming scheme]]).
The linking mechanism, in particular, needs just the identifier in the
file name ([[#h:fc913d54-26c8-4c41-be86-999839e8ad31][Linking notes]]).

We write front matter in notes for the user's convenience and for other
tools to make use of that information (e.g. Org's export mechanism).
The renaming mechanism takes care to keep this data in sync with the
file name, when the user performs a change.

Renaming is useful for managing existing files created with Denote, but
also for converting older text files to Denote notes.

Lastly, Denote's file-naming scheme is not specific to notes or text
files: it is useful for all sorts of items, such as multimedia and PDFs
that form part of the user's longer-term storage.  While Denote does not
manage such files (e.g. doesn't create links to them), it already has
all the mechanisms to facilitate the task of renaming them.

** Rename a single file
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:7cc9e000-806a-48da-945c-711bbc7426b0
:END:

#+findex: denote-rename-file
The ~denote-rename-file~ command renames a file and updates existing
front matter if appropriate.

If in Dired, the =FILE= to be renamed is the one at point, else the
command prompts with minibuffer completion for a target file.

If =FILE= has a Denote-compliant identifier, the command retains it
while updating the =TITLE= and =KEYWORDS= fields of the file name.
Otherwise it creates an identifier based on the file's attribute of last
modification time.  If such attribute cannot be found, the identifier
falls back to the current date and time.

The default =TITLE= is retrieved from a line starting with a title field
in the file's contents, depending on the given file type ([[#h:13218826-56a5-482a-9b91-5b6de4f14261][Front matter]]).
Else, the file name is used as a default value at the minibuffer prompt.

As a final step after the =FILE=, =TITLE=, and =KEYWORDS= prompts, ask
for confirmation, showing the difference between old and new file names.
For example:

#+begin_example
Rename sample.txt to 20220612T052900--my-sample-title__testing.txt? (y or n)
#+end_example

The file type extension (e.g. =.txt=) is read from the underlying file
and is preserved through the renaming process.  Files that have no
extension are simply left without one.

Renaming only occurs relative to the current directory.  Files are not
moved between directories.

If the =FILE= has Denote-style front matter for the =TITLE= and
=KEYWORDS=, this command asks to rewrite their values in order to
reflect the new input (this step always requires confirmation and the
underlying buffer is not saved, so consider invoking
~diff-buffer-with-file~ to double-check the effect).  The rewrite of the
=FILE= and =KEYWORDS= in the front matter should not affect the rest of
the block.

If the file doesn't have front matter but is among the supported file
types (per ~denote-file-type~), the ~denote-rename-file~ command adds
front matter at the top of it and leaves the buffer unsaved for further
inspection.

This command is intended to (i) rename existing Denote notes while
updating their title and keywords in the front matter, (ii) convert
existing supported file types to Denote notes, and (ii) rename non-note
files (e.g. PDF) that can benefit from Denote's file-naming scheme.  The
latter is a convenience we provide, since we already have all the
requisite mechanisms in place (though Denote does not---and will
not---manage such files).

** Rename multiple files at once
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:1b6b2c78-42f0-45b8-9ef0-6de21a8b2cde
:END:

#+findex: denote-dired-rename-marked-files
The ~denote-dired-rename-marked-files~ command renames marked files in
Dired to conform with our file-naming scheme.  The operation does the
following:

- the file's existing file name is retained and becomes the =TITLE=
  field, per Denote's file-naming scheme;

- the =TITLE= is sluggified and downcased, per our conventions;

- an identifier is prepended to the =TITLE=;

- the file's extension is retained;

- a prompt is asked once for the =KEYWORDS= field and the input is
  applied to all file names;

- if the file is recognized as a Denote note, this command adds or
  rewrites front matter to include the new keywords.  A confirmation to
  carry out this step is performed once at the outset.  Note that the
  affected buffers are not saved.  The user can thus check them to
  confirm that the new front matter does not cause any problems
  (e.g. with the command ~diff-buffer-with-file~).  Multiple buffers can
  be saved with ~save-some-buffers~ (read its doc string).  The addition
  of front matter takes place only if the given file has the appropriate
  file type extension (per the user option ~denote-file-type~).

** Rename a single file based on its front matter
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:3ab08ff4-81fa-4d24-99cb-79f97c13a373
:END:

#+findex: denote-rename-file-using-front-matter
In the previous section, we covered the more general mechanism of the
command ~denote-rename-file~ ([[#h:7cc9e000-806a-48da-945c-711bbc7426b0][Rename a single file]]).  There is also a
way to have the same outcome by making Denote read the data in the
current file's front matter and use it to construct/update the file
name.  The command for this is ~denote-rename-file-using-front-matter~.
It is only relevant for files that (i) are among the supported file
types, per ~denote-file-type~, and (ii) have the requisite front matter
in place.

Suppose you have an =.org= file with this front matter ([[#h:13218826-56a5-482a-9b91-5b6de4f14261][Front matter]]):

#+begin_example
#+title:      My sample note file
#+date:       [2022-08-05 Fri 13:10]
#+filetags:   :testing:
#+identifier: 20220805T131044
#+end_example

Its file name reflects this information:

: 20220805T131044--my-sample-note-file__testing.org

You want to change its title and keywords manually, so you modify it thus:

#+begin_example
#+title:      My modified sample note file
#+date:       [2022-08-05 Fri 13:10]
#+filetags:   :testing:denote:emacs:
#+identifier: 20220805T131044
#+end_example

The file name still shows the old title and keywords.  So after saving
the buffer, you invoke ~denote-rename-file-using-front-matter~ and it
updates the file name to:

: 20220805T131044--my-modified-sample-note-file__testing_denote_emacs.org

The renaming is subject to a "yes or no" prompt that shows the old and
new names, just so the user is certain about the change.

The identifier of the file, if any, is never modified even if it is
edited in the front matter: Denote considers the file name to be the
source of truth in this case, to avoid potential breakage with typos and
the like.

** Rename multiple files based on their front matter
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:ea5673cd-e6ca-4c42-a066-07dc6c9d57f8
:END:

#+findex: denote-dired-rename-marked-files-using-front-matter
As already noted, Denote can rename a file based on the data in its
front matter ([[#h:3ab08ff4-81fa-4d24-99cb-79f97c13a373][Rename a single file based on its front matter]]).  The
command ~denote-dired-rename-marked-files-using-front-matter~ extends
this principle to a batch operation which applies to all marked files in
Dired.

Marked files must count as notes for the purposes of Denote, which means
that they at least have an identifier in their file name and use a
supported file type, per ~denote-file-type~.  Files that do not meet
this criterion are ignored.

The operation does the following:

- the title in the front matter becomes the =TITLE= component of the
  file name ([[#h:4e9c7512-84dc-4dfb-9fa9-e15d51178e5d][The file-naming scheme]]);

- the keywords in the front matter are used for the =KEYWORDS= component
  of the file name and are processed accordingly, if needed;

- the identifier remains unchanged in the file name even if it is
  modified in the front matter (this is done to avoid breakage caused by
  typos and the like).

NOTE that files must be saved, because Denote reads from the underlying
file, not a modified buffer (this is done to avoid potential mistakes).
The return value of a modified buffer is the one prior to the
modification, i.e. the one already written on disk.

This command is useful for synchronizing multiple file names with their
respective front matter.

* The file-naming scheme
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:4e9c7512-84dc-4dfb-9fa9-e15d51178e5d
:END:

#+vindex: denote-directory
Notes are stored the ~denote-directory~.  The default path is
=~/Documents/notes=.  The ~denote-directory~ can be a flat listing,
meaning that it has no subdirectories, or it can be a directory tree.
Either way, Denote takes care to only consider "notes" as valid
candidates in the relevant operations and will omit other files or
directories.

Every note produced by Denote follows this pattern ([[#h:17896c8c-d97a-4faa-abf6-31df99746ca6][Points of entry]]):

: DATE--TITLE__KEYWORDS.EXTENSION

The =DATE= field represents the date in year-month-day format followed
by the capital letter =T= (for "time") and the current time in
hour-minute-second notation.  The presentation is compact:
=20220531T091625=.  The =DATE= serves as the unique identifier of each
note.

The =TITLE= field is the title of the note, as provided by the user.  It
automatically gets downcased and hyphenated.  An entry about "Economics
in the Euro Area" produces an =economics-in-the-euro-area= string for
the =TITLE= of the file name.

#+vindex: denote-allow-multi-word-keywords
The =KEYWORDS= field consists of one or more entries demarcated by an
underscore (the separator is inserted automatically).  Each keyword is a
string provided by the user at the relevant prompt which broadly
describes the contents of the entry.  Keywords that need to be more than
one-word-long must be written with hyphens: any other character, such as
spaces or the plus sign is automatically converted into a hyphen.  So
when =emacs_library= appears in a file name, it is interpreted as two
distinct keywords, whereas =emacs-library= is one keyword.  This is
reflected in how the keywords are recorded in the note ([[#h:13218826-56a5-482a-9b91-5b6de4f14261][Front matter]]).
While Denote supports multi-word keywords by default, the user option
~denote-allow-multi-word-keywords~ can be set to nil to forcibly join
all words into one, meaning that an input of =word1 word2= will be
written as =word1word2=.

#+vindex: denote-file-type
The =EXTENSION= is the file type.  By default, it is =.org= (~org-mode~)
though the user option ~denote-file-type~ provides support for Markdown
with YAML or TOML variants (=.md= which runs ~markdown-mode~) and plain
text (=.txt= via ~text-mode~).  Consult its doc string for the minutiae.
While files end in the =.org= extension by default, the Denote code base
does not actually depend on org.el and/or its accoutrements.

Examples:

: 20220610T043241--initial-thoughts-on-the-zettelkasten-method__notetaking.org
: 20220610T062201--define-custom-org-hyperlink-type__denote_emacs_package.md
: 20220610T162327--on-hierarchy-and-taxis__notetaking_philosophy.txt

The different field separators, namely =--= and =__= introduce an
efficient way to anchor searches (such as with Emacs commands like
~isearch~ or from the command-line with ~find~ and related).  A query
for =_word= always matches a keyword, while a regexp in the form of,
say, ="\\([0-9T]+?\\)--\\(.*?\\)_"= captures the date in group =\1= and
the title in =\2= (test any regular expression in the current buffer by
invoking =M-x re-builder=).

[[#h:1a953736-86c2-420b-b566-fb22c97df197][Features of the file-naming scheme for searching or filtering]].

While Denote is an Emacs package, notes should work long-term and not
depend on the functionality of a specific program.  The file-naming
scheme we apply guarantees that a listing is readable in a variety of
contexts.

** Sluggified title and keywords
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:ae8b19a1-7f67-4258-96b3-370a72c43f4e
:END:

Denote has to be highly opinionated about which characters can be used
in file names and the file's front matter in order to enforce its
file-naming scheme.  The private variable ~denote--punctuation-regexp~
holds the relevant value.  In simple terms:

+ What we count as "illegal characters" are converted into hyphens.

+ Input for a file title is hyphenated and downcased.  The original
  value is preserved in the note's contents ([[#h:13218826-56a5-482a-9b91-5b6de4f14261][Front matter]]).

+ Keywords should not have spaces or other delimiters.  If they do, they
  are converted into hyphens.  Keywords are always downcased.

** Features of the file-naming scheme for searching or filtering
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:1a953736-86c2-420b-b566-fb22c97df197
:END:

File names have three fields and two sets of field delimiters between
them:

: DATE--TITLE__KEYWORDS.EXTENSION

The first field delimiter is the double hyphen, while the second is the
double underscore.  These practically serve as anchors for easier
searching.  Consider this example:

: 20220621T062327--introduction-to-denote__denote_emacs.txt

You will notice that there are two matches for the word =denote=: one in
the title field and another in the keywords' field.  Because of the
distinct field delimiters, if we search for =-denote= we only match the
first instance while =_denote= targets the second one.  When sorting
through your notes, this kind of specificity is invaluable---and you get
it for free from the file names alone!

Users can get a lot of value out of this simple arrangement, even if
they have no knowledge of regular expressions.  One thing to consider,
for maximum effect, is to avoid using multi-word keywords as those get
hyphenated like the title and will thus interfere with the above: either
set the user option ~denote-allow-multi-word-keywords~ to nil or simply
insert single words at the relevant prompts.

* Front matter
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:13218826-56a5-482a-9b91-5b6de4f14261
:END:

Notes have their own "front matter".  This is a block of data at the top
of the file, with no empty lines between the entries, which is
automatically generated at the creation of a new note.  The front matter
includes the title and keywords (aka "tags" or "filetags", depending on
the file type) which the user specified at the relevant prompt, as well
as the date and unique identifier, which are derived automatically.

This is how it looks for Org mode (when ~denote-file-type~ is nil or the
=org= symbol):

#+begin_example
#+title:      This is a sample note
#+date:       [2022-06-30 Thu 16:09]
#+filetags:   :denote:testing:
#+identifier: 20220630T160934
#+end_example

For Markdown with YAML (~denote-file-type~ has the =markdown-yaml=
value), the front matter looks like this:

#+begin_example
---
title:      "This is a sample note"
date:       2022-06-30T16:09:58+03:00
tags:       ["denote", "testing"]
identifier: "20220630T160958"
---
#+end_example

For Markdown with TOML (~denote-file-type~ has the =markdown-toml=
value), it is:

#+begin_example
+++
title      = "This is a sample note"
date       = 2022-06-30T16:10:13+03:00
tags       = ["denote", "testing"]
identifier = "20220630T161013"
+++
#+end_example

And for plain text (~denote-file-type~ has the =text= value), we have
the following:

#+begin_example
title:      This is a sample note
date:       2022-06-30
tags:       denote  testing
identifier: 20220630T161028
---------------------------
#+end_example

#+vindex: denote-date-format
The format of the date in the front matter is controlled by the user
option ~denote-date-format~.  When nil, Denote uses a file-type-specific
format:

- For Org, an inactive timestamp is used, such as
  =[2022-06-30 Wed 15:31]=.

- For Markdown, the RFC3339 standard is applied:
  =2022-06-30T15:48:00+03:00=.

- For plain text, the format is that of ISO 8601: =2022-06-30=.

If the value is a string, ignore the above and use it instead.  The
string must include format specifiers for the date.  These are described
in the doc string of ~format-time-string~..

** Change the front matter format
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:7f918854-5ed4-4139-821f-8ee9ba06ad15
:END:

Per Denote's design principles, the code is hackable.  All front matter
is stored in variables that are intended for public use.  We do not
declare those as "user options" because (i) they expect the user to have
some degree of knowledge in Emacs Lisp and (ii) implement custom code.

[ NOTE for tinkerers: code intended for internal use includes double
  hyphens in its symbol.  "Internal use" means that it can be changed
  without warning and with no further reference in the change log.  Do
  not use any of it without understanding the consequences. ]

The variables which hold the front matter format are:

#+vindex: denote-org-front-matter
- ~denote-org-front-matter~

#+vindex: denote-text-front-matter
- ~denote-text-front-matter~

#+vindex: denote-toml-front-matter
- ~denote-toml-front-matter~

#+vindex: denote-yaml-front-matter
- ~denote-yaml-front-matter~

These variables hold a string with specifiers that are used by the
~format~ function.  The formatting operation passes four arguments (five
in the case of ~denote-text-front-matter~ as noted in its doc string)
which include the values of the given entries.  The doc string of
~denote-org-front-matter~ describes the technicalities:

#+begin_quote
The order of the arguments is TITLE, DATE, KEYWORDS, ID.  If you are an
advanced user who wants to edit this variable to affect how front matter
is produced, consider using something like %2$s to control where Nth
argument is placed.

Make sure to:

1. Not use empty lines inside the front matter block.

2. Insert at least one empty line after the front matter block and do
   not use any empty line before it.

These help with consistency and might prove useful if we ever need to
operate on the front matter as a whole.
#+end_quote

With those granted, below are some examples.  The approach is the same
for all variables.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Like the default, but upcase the entries
(setq denote-org-front-matter
  "#+TITLE:      %s
#+DATE:       %s
#+FILETAGS:   %s
#+IDENTIFIER: %s
\n")

;; Change the order (notice the %N$s notation)
(setq denote-org-front-matter
  "#+title:      %1$s
#+filetags:   %3$s
#+date:       %2$s
#+identifier: %4$s
\n")

;; Remove the date
(setq denote-org-front-matter
  "#+title:      %1$s
#+filetags:   %3$s
#+identifier: %4$s
\n")

;; Remove the date and the identifier
(setq denote-org-front-matter
  "#+title:      %1$s
#+filetags:   %3$s
\n")
#+end_src

Note that ~setq~ has a global effect: it affects the creation of all new
notes.  Depending on the workflow, it may be preferrable to have a
custom command which ~let~ binds the different format.  We shall not
provide examples at this point as this is a more advanced feature and we
are not yet sure what the user's needs are.  Please provide feedback and
we shall act accordingly.

** Regenerate front matter
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:54b48277-e0e5-4188-ad54-ef3db3b7e772
:END:

#+findex: denote-add-front-matter
Sometimes the user needs to produce new front matter for an existing
note.  Perhaps because they accidentally deleted a line and could not
undo the operation.  The command ~denote-add-front-matter~ can be used
for this very purpose.

In interactive use, ~denote-add-front-matter~ must be invoked from a
buffer that visits a Denote note.  It prompts for a title and then for
keywords.  These are the standard prompts we already use for note
creation, so the keywords' prompt allows minibuffer completion and the
input of multiple entries, each separated by a comma ([[#h:17896c8c-d97a-4faa-abf6-31df99746ca6][Points of entry]]).

The newly created front matter is added to the top of the file.

This command does not rename the file (e.g. to update the keywords).  To
rename a file by reading its front matter as input, the user can rely on
~denote-rename-file-using-front-matter~ ([[#h:532e8e2a-9b7d-41c0-8f4b-3c5cbb7d4dca][Renaming files]]).

Note that ~denote-add-front-matter~ is useful only for existing Denote
notes.  If the user needs to convert a generic text file to a Denote
note, they can use one of the command which first rename the file to
make it comply with our file-naming scheme and then add the relevant
front matter.

* Linking notes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:fc913d54-26c8-4c41-be86-999839e8ad31
:END:

Denote offers several commands for linking between notes.

All links target files which are Denote notes.  This means that they
have our file-naming scheme, are writable/regular (not directory, named
pipe, etc.), and use the appropriate file type extension (per
~denote-file-type~).  Furthermore, the files need to be inside the
~denote-directory~ or one of its subdirectories.  No other file is
recognised.

The following sections delve into the details.

** Adding a single link
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:5e5e3370-12ab-454f-ba09-88ff44214324
:END:

#+findex: denote-link
The ~denote-link~ command inserts a link at point to an entry specified
at the minibuffer prompt.  Links are formatted depending on the file
type of current note.  In Org and plain text buffers, links are
formatted thus: =[[denote:IDENTIFIER][TITLE]]=.  While in Markdown they
are expressed as =[TITLE](denote:IDENTIFIER)=.

When ~denote-link~ is called with a prefix argument (=C-u= by default),
it formats links like =[[denote:IDENTIFIER]]=.  The user might prefer
its simplicity.

Inserted links are automatically buttonized and remain active for as
long as the buffer is available.  In Org this is handled by the major
mode: the =denote:= hyperlink type works exactly like the standard
=file:=.  In Markdown and plain text, Denote performs the buttonization
of those links.  To buttonize links in existing files while visiting
them, the user must add this snippet to their setup (it already excludes
Org):

#+findex: denote-link-buttonize-buffer
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'find-file-hook #'denote-link-buttonize-buffer)
#+end_src

The ~denote-link-buttonize-buffer~ is also an interactive function in
case the user needs it.

Links are created only for files which qualify as a "note" for our
purposes ([[#h:fc913d54-26c8-4c41-be86-999839e8ad31][Linking notes]]).

#+vindex: denote-faces-link
Links are styled with the ~denote-faces-link~ face, which looks exactly
like an ordinary link by default.  This is just a convenience for the
user/theme in case they want =denote:= links to remain distinct from
other links.

#+vindex: denote-faces-broken-link
In Org files, broken links get the ~denote-faces-broken-link~ if the
linked identifier does not resolve to a file path with a note.  The
ability to use distinct faces for such a scenario is a feature of Org,
which is not available in other supported file types that use Emacs'
generic button mechanism.

The command ~denote-link-add-links~ adds links at point matching a
regular expression or plain string.  The links are inserted as a
typographic list, such as:

#+begin_example
- link1
- link2
- link3
#+end_example

Each link is formatted according to the file type of the current note,
as explained further above about the ~denote-link~ command.  The current
note is excluded from the matching entries (adding a link to itself is
pointless).

When called with a prefix argument (=C-u=) ~denote-link-add-links~ will
format all links as =[[denote:IDENTIFIER]]=, hence a typographic list:

#+begin_example
- [[denote:IDENTIFIER-1]]
- [[denote:IDENTIFIER-2]]
- [[denote:IDENTIFIER-3]]
#+end_example

Same examples of a regular expression that can be used with this
command:

- =journal= match all files which include =journal= anywhere in their
  name.

- =_journal= match all files which include =journal= as a keyword.

- =^2022.*_journal= match all file names starting with =2022= and
  including the keyword =journal=.

- =\.txt= match all files including =.txt=.  In practical terms, this
  only applies to the file extension, as Denote automatically removes
  dots (and other characters) from the base file name.

If files are created with ~denote-sort-keywords~ as non-nil (the
default), then it is easy to write a regexp that includes multiple
keywords in alphabetic order:

- =_denote.*_package= match all files that include both the =denote= and
  =package= keywords, in this order.

- =\(.*denote.*package.*\)\|\(.*package.*denote.*\)= is the same as
  above, but out-of-order.

Remember that regexp constructs only need to be escaped once (like =\|=)
when done interactively but twice when called from Lisp.  What we show
above is for interactive usage.

Links are created only for files which qualify as a "note" for our
purposes ([[#h:fc913d54-26c8-4c41-be86-999839e8ad31][Linking notes]]).

** Insert links from marked files in Dired
:PROPERTIES:

#+findex: denote-link-dired-marked-notes
The command ~denote-link-dired-marked-notes~ is similar to
~denote-link-add-links~ in that it inserts in the buffer a typographic
list of links to Denote notes ([[#h:9bec2c83-36ca-4951-aefc-7187c5463f90][Insert links matching a regexp]]).  Though
instead of reading a regular expression, it lets the user mark files in
Dired and link to them.  This should be easier for users of all skill
levels, instead of having to write a potentially complex regular
expression.

If there are multiple buffers that visit a Denote note, this command
will ask to select one among them, using minibuffer completion.  If
there is only one buffer, it will operate in it outright.  If there are
no buffers, it will produce an error.

With optional =ID-ONLY= as a prefix argument (=C-u= by default), the
command inserts links with just the identifier, which is the same
principle as with ~denote-link~ and others ([[#h:5e5e3370-12ab-454f-ba09-88ff44214324][Adding a single link]]).

The command ~denote-link-dired-marked-notes~ is meant to be used from a
Dired buffer.

As always, links are created only for files which qualify as a "note"
for our purposes ([[#h:fc913d54-26c8-4c41-be86-999839e8ad31][Linking notes]]).

** The backlinks' buffer
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:c73f1f68-e214-49d5-b369-e694f6a5d708
:END:

#+findex: denote-link-backlinks
The command ~denote-link-backlinks~ produces a bespoke buffer which
displays the file name of all notes linking to the current one.  Each
file name appears on its own line and is buttonized so that it performs
the action of visiting the referenced file.  The backlinks' buffer looks
like this:

#+begin_example
Backlinks to "On being honest" (20220614T130812)
------------------------------------------------

20220614T145606--let-this-glance-become-a-stare__journal.txt
20220616T182958--not-feeling-butterflies-in-your-stomach__journal.txt
#+end_example

#+vindex: denote-link-fontify-backlinks
The backlinks' buffer is fontified by default, though the user has
access to the ~denote-link-fontify-backlinks~ option to disable this
effect by setting its value to nil.

#+vindex: denote-link-backlinks-display-buffer-action
The placement of the backlinks' buffer is subject to the user option
~denote-link-backlinks-display-buffer-action~.  Due to the nature of the
underlying ~display-buffer~ mechanism, this inevitably is a relatively
advanced feature.  By default, the backlinks' buffer is displayed below
the current window.  The doc string of our user option includes a sample
configuration that places the buffer in a left side window instead.
Reproducing it here for the sake of convenience:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq denote-link-backlinks-display-buffer-action
      '((display-buffer-reuse-window
         display-buffer-in-side-window)
        (side . left)
        (slot . 99)
        (window-width . 0.3)))
#+end_src

#+findex: denote-backlinks-mode
#+vindex: denote-backlinks-mode-map
The backlinks' buffer runs the major-mode ~denote-backlinks-mode~, which
is derived from ~special-mode~.  It binds keys to move between links
with =n= (next) and =p= (previous).  These are stored in the
~denote-backlinks-mode-map~ (use =M-x describe-mode= (=C-h m=) in an
unfamiliar buffer to learn more about it).

Note that the backlinking facility uses Emacs' built-in Xref
infrastructure.  On some operating systems, the user may need to add
certain executables to the relevant environment variable.

[[#h:42f6b07e-5956-469a-8294-17f9cf62eb2b][Why do I get "Search failed with status 1" when I search for backlinks?]]

** Writing metanotes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:6060a7e6-f179-4d42-a9de-a9968aaebecc
:END:

A "metanote" is an entry that describes other entries who have something
in common.  Writing metanotes can be part of a workflow where the user
periodically reviews their work in search of patterns and deeper
insights.  For example, you might want to read your journal entries from
the past year to reflect on your experiences, evolution as a person, and
the like.

The commands ~denote-link-add-links~, ~denote-link-dired-marked-notes~
are suited for this task.

[[#h:9bec2c83-36ca-4951-aefc-7187c5463f90][Insert links matching a regexp]].

[[#h:9cbb692e-5d8a-44a6-9193-899a07872a07][Insert links from marked files in Dired]].

You will create your metanote the way you use Denote ordinarily
(metanotes may have the =metanote= keyword, among others), write an
introduction or however you want to go about it, invoke the command
which inserts multiple links at once (see the above-cited nodes), and
continue writing.

Metanotes can serve as entry points to groupings of individual notes.
They are not the same as a filtered list of files, i.e. what you would
do in Dired or the minibuffer where you narrow the list of notes to a
given query.  Metanotes contain the filtered list plus your thoughts
about it.  The act of purposefully grouping notes together and
contemplating on their shared patterns is what adds value.

Your future self will appreciate metanotes for the function they serve
in encapsulating knowledge, while current you will be equipped with the
knowledge derived from the deliberate self-reflection.

** Visiting linked files via the minibuffer
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:1bc2adad-dca3-4878-b9f0-b105d5dec6f4
:END:

#+findex: denote-link-find-file
Denote has a major-mode-agnostic mechanism to collect all linked file
references in the current buffer and return them as an appropriately
formatted list.  This list can then be used in interactive commands.
The ~denote-link-find-file~ is such a command.  It uses minibuffer
completion to visit a file that is linked to from the current note.  The
candidates have the correct metadata, which is ideal for integration
with other standards-compliant tools ([[#h:8ed2bb6f-b5be-4711-82e9-8bee5bb06ece][Extending Denote]]).  For instance,
a package such as =marginalia= will display accurate annotations, while
the =embark= package will be able to work its magic such as in exporting
the list into a filtered Dired buffer (i.e. a familiar Dired listing
with only the files of the current minibuffer session).

** Miscellaneous information about links
:PROPERTIES:

#+findex: denote-link-insert-link
#+findex: denote-link-show-backlinks-buffer
#+findex: denote-link-insert-links-matching-regexp
For convenience, the ~denote-link~ command has an alias called
~denote-link-insert-link~.  The ~denote-link-backlinks~ can also be used
as ~denote-link-show-backlinks-buffer~.  While ~denote-link-add-links~
is aliased ~denote-link-insert-links-matching-regexp~.  The purpose of
these aliases is to offer alternative, more descriptive names of select
commands.

* Fontification in Dired
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:337f9cf0-9f66-45af-b73f-f6370472fb51
:END:

#+findex: denote-dired-mode
One of the upsides of Denote's file-naming scheme is the predictable
pattern it establishes, which appears as a near-tabular presentation in
a listing of notes (i.e. in Dired).  The ~denote-dired-mode~ can help
enhance this impression, by fontifying the components of the file name
to make the date (identifier) and keywords stand out.

There are two ways to set the mode.  Either use it for all directories,
which probably is not needed:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'dired-mode-hook #'denote-dired-mode)
#+end_src

#+vindex: denote-dired-directories
#+findex: denote-dired-mode-in-directories
Or configure the user option ~denote-dired-directories~ and then set up
the function ~denote-dired-mode-in-directories~:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; We use different ways to specify a path for demo purposes.
(setq denote-dired-directories
      (list denote-directory
            (thread-last denote-directory (expand-file-name "attachments"))
            (expand-file-name "~/Documents/vlog")))

(add-hook 'dired-mode-hook #'denote-dired-mode-in-directories)
#+end_src

The faces we define for this purpose are:

#+vindex: denote-faces-date
#+vindex: denote-faces-delimiter
#+vindex: denote-faces-extension
#+vindex: denote-faces-keywords
#+vindex: denote-faces-subdirectory
#+vindex: denote-faces-time
#+vindex: denote-faces-title
+ ~denote-faces-date~
+ ~denote-faces-delimiter~
+ ~denote-faces-extension~
+ ~denote-faces-keywords~
+ ~denote-faces-subdirectory~
+ ~denote-faces-time~
+ ~denote-faces-title~

For the time being, the =diredfl= package is not compatible with this
facility.

The ~denote-dired-mode~ does not only fontify note files that were
created by Denote: it covers every file name that follows our naming
conventions ([[#h:4e9c7512-84dc-4dfb-9fa9-e15d51178e5d][The file-naming scheme]]).  This is particularly useful for
scenaria where, say, one wants to organise their collection of PDFs and
multimedia in a systematic way (and, perhaps, use them as attachments
for the notes Denote produces if you are writing Org notes and are using
its standand attachments' facility).

* Minibuffer histories
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:82dc1203-d689-44b2-9a6c-b37776209651
:END:

Denote has a dedicated minibuffer history for each one of its prompts.
This practically means that using =M-p= (~previous-history-element~) and
=M-n= (~next-history-element~) will only cycle through the relevant
record of inputs, such as your latest titles in the =TITLE= prompt, and
keywords in the =KEYWORDS= prompt.

The built-in =savehist= library saves minibuffer histories.  Sample
configuration:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'savehist)
(setq savehist-file (locate-user-emacs-file "savehist"))
(setq history-length 500)
(setq history-delete-duplicates t)
(setq savehist-save-minibuffer-history t)
(add-hook 'after-init-hook #'savehist-mode)
#+end_src

* Extending Denote
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:8ed2bb6f-b5be-4711-82e9-8bee5bb06ece
:END:

Denote is a tool with a narrow scope: create notes and link between
them, based on the aforementioned file-naming scheme.  For other common
operations the user is advised to rely on standard Emacs facilities or
specialised third-party packages.  This section covers the details.

** Keep a journal or diary
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:4a6d92dd-19eb-4fcc-a7b5-05ce04da3a92
:END:

While there are subtle technical differences between a journal and a
diary, we will consider those equivalent in the interest of brevity:
they both describe a personal space that holds a record of your thoughts
about your experiences and/or view of events in the world.

Suppose you are committed to writing an entry every day.  Unlike what we
demonstrated before, your writing will follow a regular naming pattern.
You know that the title of the new note must always look like =Tuesday
14 June 2022= and the keyword has to be =journal= or =diary=.  As such,
you want to automate the task instead of being prompted each time, as is
the norm with ~denote~ and the relevant commands ([[#h:17896c8c-d97a-4faa-abf6-31df99746ca6][Points of entry]]).
This is easy to accomplish because ~denote~ can be called from Lisp and
given the required arguments of =TITLE= and =KEYWORDS= directly.  All
you need is a simple wrapper function:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my-denote-journal ()
  "Create an entry tagged 'journal' with the date as its title."
  (interactive)
  (denote
   (format-time-string "%A %e %B %Y") ; format like Tuesday 14 June 2022
   '("journal"))) ; multiple keywords are a list of strings: '("one" "two")
#+end_src

By invoking ~my-denote-journal~ you will go straight into the newly
created note and commit to your writing outright.

Of course, you can always set up the function so that it asks for a
=TITLE= but still automatically applies the =journal= tag:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun denote-journal-with-title ()
  "Create an entry tagged 'journal', while prompting for a title."
  (interactive)
  (denote
   (denote--title-prompt) ; ask for title, instead of using human-readable date
   '("journal")))
#+end_src

Sometimes journaling is done with the intent to hone one's writing
skills.  Perhaps you are learning a new language or wish to communicate
your ideas with greater clarity and precision.  As with everything that
requires a degree of sophistication, you have to work for it---write,
write, write!

One way to test your progress is to set a timer.  It helps you gauge
your output and its quality.  To use a timer with Emacs, consider the
=tmr= package:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my-denote-journal-with-tmr ()
  "Like `my-denote-journal', but also set a 10-minute timer.
The `tmr' command is part of the `tmr' package."
  (interactive)
  (denote
   (format-time-string "%A %e %B %Y")
   '("journal"))
  (tmr "10" "Practice writing in my journal")) ; set 10 minute timer with a description
#+end_src

Once the timer elapses, stop writing and review your performance.
Practice makes perfect!

[ As Denote matures, we may add hooks to control what happens before or
  after the creation of a new note.  We shall also document more
  examples of tasks that can be accomplished with this package. ]

** Narrow the list of files in Dired
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:ea173a01-69ef-4574-89a7-6e60ede02f13
:END:

Emacs' standard file manager (or directory editor) can read a regular
expression to mark the matching files.  This is the command
~dired-mark-files-regexp~, which is bound to =% m= by default.  For
example, =% m _denote= will match all files that have the =denote=
keyword ([[#h:1a953736-86c2-420b-b566-fb22c97df197][Features of the file-naming scheme for searching or filtering]]).

Once the files are matched, the user has to options: (i) narrow the list
to the matching items or (ii) exclude the matching items from the list.

For the former, we want to toggle the marks by typing =t= (calls the
command ~dired-toggle-marks~ by default) and then hit the letter =k=
(for ~dired-do-kill-lines~).  The remaining files are those that match
the regexp that was provided earlier.

For the latter approach of filtering out the matching items, simply
involves the use of the =k= command (~dired-do-kill-lines~) to omit the
marked files from the list.

These sequences can be combined to incrementally narrow the list.  Note
that ~dired-do-kill-lines~ does not delete files: it simply hides them
from the current view.

Revert to the original listing with =g= (~revert-buffer~).

For a convenient wrapper, consider this example:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar prot-dired--limit-hist '()
  "Minibuffer history for `prot-dired-limit-regexp'.")

;;;###autoload
(defun prot-dired-limit-regexp (regexp omit)
  "Limit Dired to keep files matching REGEXP.

With optional OMIT argument as a prefix (\\[universal-argument]),
exclude files matching REGEXP.

Restore the buffer with \\<dired-mode-map>`\\[revert-buffer]'."
  (interactive
   (list
    (read-regexp
     (concat "Files "
             (when current-prefix-arg
               (propertize "NOT " 'face 'warning))
             "matching PATTERN: ")
     nil 'prot-dired--limit-hist)
    current-prefix-arg))
  (dired-mark-files-regexp regexp)
  (unless omit (dired-toggle-marks))
  (dired-do-kill-lines))
#+end_src

** Use Embark to collect minibuffer candidates
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:edf9b651-86eb-4d5f-bade-3c9e270082f0
:END:

=embark= is a remarkable package that lets you perform relevant,
context-dependent actions using a prefix key (simplifying in the
interest of brevity).

For our purposes, Embark can be used to produce a Dired listing directly
from the minibuffer.  Suppose the current note has links to three other
notes.  You might use the ~denote-link-find-file~ command to pick one
via the minibuffer.  But why not turn those three links into their own
Dired listing?  While in the minibuffer, invoke ~embark-act~ which you
may have already bound to =C-.= and then follow it up with =E= (for the
~embark-export~ command).

This pattern can be repeated with any list of candidates, meaning that
you can narrow the list by providing some input before eventually
exporting the results with Embark.

Overall, this is very powerful and you might prefer it over doing the
same thing directly in Dired, since you also benefit from all the power
of the minibuffer ([[#h:ea173a01-69ef-4574-89a7-6e60ede02f13][Narrow the list of files in Dired]]).

** Search file contents
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:76198fab-d6d2-4c67-9ccb-7a08cc883952
:END:

Emacs provides built-in commands which are wrappers of standard Unix
tools: =M-x grep= lets the user input the flags of a ~grep~ call and
pass a regular expression to the =-e= flag.

The author of Denote uses this thin wrapper instead:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar prot-search--grep-hist '()
  "Input history of grep searches.")

;;;###autoload
(defun prot-search-grep (regexp &optional recursive)
  "Run grep for REGEXP.

Search in the current directory using `lgrep'.  With optional
prefix argument (\\[universal-argument]) for RECURSIVE, run a
search starting from the current directory with `rgrep'."
  (interactive
   (list
    (read-from-minibuffer (concat (if current-prefix-arg
                                      (propertize "Recursive" 'face 'warning)
                                    "Local")
                                  " grep for PATTERN: ")
                          nil nil nil 'prot-search--grep-hist)
    current-prefix-arg))
  (unless grep-command
    (grep-compute-defaults))
  (if recursive
      (rgrep regexp "*" default-directory)
    (lgrep regexp "*" default-directory)))
#+end_src

Rather than maintain custom code, consider using the excellent =consult=
package: it provides commands such as ~consult-grep~ and ~consult-find~
which provide live results and are generally easier to use than the
built-in commands.

** Bookmark the directory with the notes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:1bba4c1e-6812-4749-948f-57df4fd49b36
:END:

Part of the reason Denote does not reinvent existing functionality is to
encourage you to learn more about Emacs.  You do not need a bespoke
"jump to my notes" directory because such commands do not scale well.
Will you have a "jump to my downloads" then another for multimedia and
so on?  No.

Emacs has a built-in framework for recording persistent markers to
locations.  Visit the ~denote-directory~ (or any dir/file for that
matter) and invoke the ~bookmark-set~ command (bound to =C-x r m= by
default).  It lets you create a bookmark.

The list of bookmarks can be reviewed with the ~bookmark-bmenu-list~
command (bound to =C-x r l= by default).  A minibuffer interface is
available with ~bookmark-jump~ (=C-x r b=).

If you use the =consult= package, its default ~consult-buffer~ command
has the means to group together buffers, recent files, and bookmarks.
Each of those types can be narrowed to with a prefix key.  The package
=consult-dir= is an extension to =consult= which provides useful extras
for working with directories, including bookmarks.

** Use the consult-notes package
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:8907f4bc-992a-45bc-a60e-267ed1ce9c2d
:END:

If you are already using =consult= (which is a brilliant package), you
will probably like its =consult-notes= extension.  It uses the familiar
mechanisms of Consult to filter searches via a prefix key.  For example:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq consult-notes-sources
      `(("Notes"  ?n ,denote-directory)
        ("Books"  ?b "~/Documents/books")))
#+end_src

With the above, =M-x consult-notes= will list the files in those two
directories.  If you type =n= and space, it narrows the list to just the
notes, while =b= does the same for books.

To search all your notes with grep (or ripgrep if installed -- see
=consult-notes-use-rg= variable) use the command
=consult-notes-search-in-all-notes=. This will employ grep/ripgrep for searching
terms in all the directories set in =consult-notes-sources=.

Note that =consult-notes= is in its early stages of development.  Expect
improvements in the near future (written on 2022-06-22 16:48 +0300).

** Treat your notes as a project
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:fad3eb08-ddc7-43e4-ba28-210d89668037
:END:

Emacs has a built-in library for treating a directory tree as a
"project".  This means that the contents of this tree are seen as part
of the same set, so commands like ~project-switch-to-buffer~ (=C-x p b=
by default) will only consider buffers in the current project
(e.g. three notes that are currently being visited).

Normally, a "project" is a directory tree whose root is under version
control.  For our purposes, all you need is to navigate to the
~denote-directory~ (for the shell or via Dired) and use the command-line
to run this (requires the =git= executable):

: git init

From Dired, you can type =M-!= which invokes ~dired-smart-shell-command~
and then run the git call there.

The project can then be registered by invoking any project-related
command inside of it, such as ~project-find-file~ (=C-x p f=).

It is a good idea to keep your notes under version control, as that
gives you a history of changes for each file.  We shall not delve into
the technicalities here, though suffice to note that Emacs' built-in
version control framework or the exceptionally well-crafted =magit=
package will get the job done (VC can work with other backends besides
Git).

Denote should work well for what is described in this manual.  Though we
can always do better.  These are some of the tasks that are planned for
the future and which you might want to help with ([[#h:1ebe4865-c001-4747-a6f2-0fe45aad71cd][Contributing]]).

This is a non-exhaustive list and you are always welcome to either
report or work on something else.

- [ ] Ensure integration between =denote:= links and Embark.
- [ ] Add command that expands the identifier in links to a full name.
- [ ] Add command that rewrites full names in links, if they are invalid.
- [ ] Consider completion-at-point after =denote:= links.
- [ ] Support mutually-exclusive sets of tags.

These are just ideas.  We need to consider the pros and cons in each
case and act accordingly.

* Alternatives to Denote
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:dbb51a1b-90b8-48e8-953c-e2fb3e36981e
:END:

What follows is a list of Emacs packages for note-taking.  I
(Protesilaos) have not used any of them, as I was manually applying my
file-naming scheme beforehand and by the time those packages were
available I was already hacking on the predecessor of Denote as a means
of learning Emacs Lisp (a package which I called "Unassuming Sidenotes
of Little Significance", aka "USLS" which is pronounced as "U-S-L-S" or
"useless").  As such, I cannot comment at length on the differences
between Denote and each of those packages, beside what I gather from
their documentation.

+ [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam][org-roam]] :: The de facto standard in the Emacs milieu---and rightly
  so!  It has a massive community, is featureful, and should be an
  excellent companion to anyone who is invested in the Org ecosystem
  and/or knows what "Roam" is (I don't).  It has been explained to me
  that Org Roam uses a database to store a cache about your notes.  It
  otherwise uses standard Org files.  The cache helps refer to the same
  node through aliases which can provide lots of options.  Personally, I
  follow a single-topic-per-note approach, so anything beyond that is
  overkill.  If the database is only for a cache, then maybe that has no
  downside, though I am careful with any kind of specialised program as
  it creates a dependency.  If you ask me about database software in
  particular, I have no idea how to use one, let alone debug it or
  retrieve data from it if something goes awry (I could learn, but that
  is beside the point).

+ [[https://github.com/localauthor/zk][zk (or zk.el)]] :: Reading its documentation makes me think that this is
  Denote's sibling---the two projects have a lot of things in common,
  including the preference to rely on plain files and standard tools.
  The core difference is that Denote has a strict file-naming scheme.
  Other differences in available features are, in principle, matters of
  style or circumstance: both packages can have them.  As its initials
  imply, ZK enables a zettelkasten-like workflow.  It does not enforce
  it though, letting the user adapt the method to their needs and
  requirements.

+ [[https://github.com/ymherklotz/emacs-zettelkasten][zettelkasten]] :: This is another one of Denote's relatives, at least
  insofar as the goal of simplicity is concerned.  The major difference
  is that according to its documentation "the name of the file that is
  created is just a unique ID".  This is not consistent with our
  file-naming scheme which is all about making sense of your files by
  their name alone and being able to visually parse a listing of them
  without any kind of specialised tool (e.g. =ls -l= or =ls -C= on the
  command-line from inside the ~denote-directory~ give you a
  human-readable set of files names, while =find * -maxdepth 0 -type f=
  is another approach).

+ [[https://github.com/EFLS/zetteldeft][zetteldeft]] :: This is a zettelkasten note-taking system built on top
  of the =deft= package.  Deft provides a search interface to a
  directory, in this case the one holding the user's =zetteldeft= notes.
  Denote has no such dependency and is not opinionated about how the
  user prefers to search/access their notes: use Dired, Grep, the
  =consult= package, or whatever else you already have set up for all
  things Emacs, not just your notes.

Searching through =M-x list-packages= for "zettel" brings up more
matches.  =zetteldesk= is an extension to Org Roam and, as such, I
cannot possibly know what Org Roam truly misses and what the added-value
of this package is.  =neuron-mode= builds on top of an external program
called =neuron=, which I have never used.

Searching for "note" gives us a few more results.  =notes-mode= has
precious little documentation and I cannot tell what it actually does
(as I said in my presentation for LibrePlanet 2022, inadequate docs are
a bug).  =side-notes= differs from what we try to do with Denote, as it
basically gives you the means to record your thoughts about some other
project you are working on and keep them on the side: so it and Denote
should not be mutually exclusive.

If I missed something, please let me know.

:END:

I (Protesilaos) answer some questions I have received or might get.  It
is assumed that you have read the rest of this manual: I will not go
into the specifics of how Denote works.

** Why develop Denote when PACKAGE already exists?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:b875450a-ae22-4899-ac23-c10fa9c279bb
:END:

I wrote Denote because I was using a variant of Denote's file-naming
scheme before I was even an Emacs user (I switched to Emacs from
Tmux+Vim+CLI in the summer of 2019).  I was originally inspired by
Jekyll, the static site generator, which I started using for my website
in 2016 (was on WordPress before).  Jekyll's files follow the
=YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.md= pattern.  I liked its efficiency relative to the
unstructured mess I had before.  Eventually, I started using that scheme
outside the confines of my website's source code.  Over time I refined
it and here we are.

Note-taking is something I take very seriously, as I am a prolific
writer (just check my website, which only reveals the tip of the
iceberg).  As such, I need a program that does exactly what I want and
which I know how to extend.  I originally tried to use Org capture
templates to create new files with a Denote-style file-naming scheme but
never managed to achieve it.  Maybe because ~org-capture~ has some
hard-coded assumptions or I simply am not competent enough to hack on
core Org facilities.  Whatever the case, an alternative was in order.

The existence of PACKAGE is never a good reason for me not to conduct my
own experiments for recreational, educational, or practical purposes.
When the question arises of "why not contribute to PACKAGE instead?" the
answer is that without me experimenting in the first place, I would lack
the skills for such a task.  Furthermore, contributing to another
package does not guarantee I get what I want in terms of workflow.

Whether you should use Denote or not is another matter altogether:
choose whatever you want.

** Why not rely exclusively on Org?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:b9831849-5c71-484e-b444-bac19cc13151
:END:

I think Org is one of Emacs' killer apps.  I also believe it is not the
right tool for every job.  When I write notes, I want to focus on
writing.  Nothing more.  I thus have no need for stuff like org-babel,
scheduling to-do items, clocking time, and so on.  The more "mental
dependencies" you add to your workflow, the heavier the burden you carry
and the less focused you are on the task at hand: there is always that
temptation to tweak the markup, tinker with some syntactic construct,
obsess about what ought to be irrelevant to writing as such.

In technical terms, I also am not fond of Org's code base (I understand
why it is the way it is---just commenting on the fact).  Ever tried to
read it?  You will routinely find functions that are tens-to-hundreds of
lines long and have all sorts of special casing.  As I am not a
programmer and only learnt to write Elisp through trial and error, I
have no confidence in my ability to make Org do what I want at that
level, hence =denote= instead of =org-denote= or something.

Perhaps the master programmer is one who can deal with complexity and
keep adding to it.  I am of the opposite view, as language---code
included---is at its communicative best when it is clear and accessible.

Make no mistake: I use Org for the agenda and also to write technical
documentation that needs to be exported to various formats, including
this very manual.

** Why care about Unix tools when you use Emacs?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:da1e2469-8f04-450b-a379-a854efa80a36
:END:

My notes form part of my longer-term storage.  I do not want to have to
rely on a special program to be able to read them or filter them.  Unix
is universal, at least as far as I am concerned.

Denote streamlines some tasks and makes things easier in general, which
is consistent with how Emacs provides a layer of interactivity on top of
Unix.  Still, Denote's utilities can, in principle, be implemented as
POSIX shell scripts (minus the Emacs-specific parts like fontification
in Dired or the buttonization of links).

Portability matters.  For example, in the future I might own a
smartphone, so I prefer not to require Emacs, Org, or some other
executable to access my files on the go.

Furthermore, I might want to share those files with someone.  If I make
Emacs a requirement, I am limiting my circle to a handful of relatively
advanced users.

Please don't misinterpret this: I am using Emacs full-time for my
computing and maintain a growing list of packages for it.  This is just
me thinking long-term.

** Why many small files instead of few large ones?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:7d2e7b8a-d484-4c1d-8688-17f70f242ad7
:END:

I have read that Org favours the latter method.  If true, I strongly
disagree with it because of the implicit dependency it introduces and
the way it favours machine-friendliness over human-readability in terms
of accessing information.  Notes are long-term storage.  I might want to
access them on (i) some device with limited features, (ii) print on
paper, (iii) share with another person who is not a tech wizard.

There are good arguments for few large files, but all either prioritize
machine-friendliness or presuppose the use of sophisticated tools like
Emacs+Org.

Good luck using =less= on a generic TTY to read a file with a zillion
words, headings, sub-headings, sub-sub-headings, property drawers, and
other constructs!  You will not get the otherwise wonderful folding of
headings the way you do in Emacs---do not take such features for
granted.

My point is that notes should be atomic to help the user---and
potentially the user's family, friends, acquaintances---make sense of
them in a wide range of scenaria.  The more program-agnostic your file
is, the better for you and/or everyone else you might share your
writings with.

Human-readability means that we optimize for what matters to us.  If (a)
you are the only one who will ever read your notes, (b) always have
access to good software like Emacs+Org, (c) do not care about printing
on paper, then Denote's model is not for you.  Maybe you need to tweak
some ~org-capture~ template to append a new entry to one mega file (I do
that for my Org agenda, by the way, as I explained before about using
the right tool for the job).

** Does Denote perform well at scale?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:863f812a-aac7-42ea-83b3-fbbdb58e08d7
:END:

Denote does not do anything fancy and has no special requirements: it
uses standard tools to accomplish ordinary tasks.  If Emacs can cope
with lots of files, then that is all you need to know: Denote will work.

To put this to the test, Peter Prevos is running simulations with R that
generate large volumes of notes.  You can read the technicalities here:
<https://lucidmanager.org/productivity/testing-denote-package/>.
Excerpt:

#+begin_quote
Using this code I generated ten thousands notes and used this to test
the Denote package to see it if works at a large scale. This tests shows
that Prot's approach is perfectly capable of working with thousands of
notes.
#+end_quote

Of course, we are always prepared to make refinements to the code, where
necessary, without compromising on the project's principles.

** I add TODOs to my files; will the many files slow down the Org agenda?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:63c2f8d4-79ed-4c55-b3ef-e048a05802c0
:END:

I have not tested it, but assume that yes, many files will slow down the
agenda due to how that works.

If you want my opinion though, decouple your knowledge base from your
ephemeral to-do list: Denote (and others) can be used for the former,
while you let standard Org work splendidly for the latter---that is what
I do, anyway.

** I want to sort by last modified, why won't Denote let me?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:a7fd5e0a-78f7-434e-aa2e-e150479c16e2
:END:

Denote does not sort files and will not reinvent tools that handle such
functionality.  This is the job of the file manager or command-line
executable that lists files.

I encourage you to read the manpage of the =ls= executable.  It will
help you in general, while it applies to Emacs as well via Dired.  The
gist is that you can update the =ls= flags that Dired uses on-the-fly:
type =C-u M-x dired-sort-toggle-or-edit= (=C-u s= by default) and append
=--sort=time= at the prompt.  To reverse the order, add the =-r= flag.
The user option ~dired-listing-switches~ sets your default preference.

** How do you handle the last modified case?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:764b5e87-cd22-4937-b5fc-af3892d6b3d8
:END:

Denote does not insert any meta data or heading pertaining to edits in
the file.  I am of the view that these either do not scale well or are
not descriptive enough.  Suppose you use a "lastmod" heading with a
timestamp: which lines where edited and what did the change amount to?

This is where an external program can be helpful.  Use a Version Control
System, such as Git, to keep track of all your notes.  Every time you
add a new file, record the addition.  Same for post-creation edits.
Your VCS will let you review the history of those changes.  For
instance, Emacs' built-in version control framework has a command that
produces a log of changes for the current file: =M-x vc-print-log=,
bound to =C-x v l= by default.  From there one can access the
corresponding diff output (use =M-x describe-mode= (=C-h m=) in an
unfamiliar buffer to learn more about it).  With Git in particular,
Emacs users have the option of the all-round excellent =magit= package.

In short: let Denote (or equivalent) create notes and link between them,
the file manager organise and provide access to files, search programs
deal with searching and narrowing, and version control software handle
the tracking of changes.

** Why do I get "Search failed with status 1" when I search for backlinks?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:42f6b07e-5956-469a-8294-17f9cf62eb2b
:END:

Denote uses [[info:emacs#Xref][Emacs' Xref]] to find backlinks.  Xref requires ~xargs~ and
one of ~grep~ or ~ripgrep~, depending on your configuration.

This is usually not an issue on *nix systems, but the necessary
executables are not available on Windows Emacs distributions.  Please
ensure that you have both ~xargs~ and either ~grep~ or ~ripgrep~
available within your ~PATH~ environment variable.

If you have ~git~ on Windows installed, then you may use the following
code (adjust the git's installation path if necessary):
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setenv "PATH" (concat (getenv "PATH") ";" "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin"))
#+end_src

                 Version 1.3, 3 November 2008


 Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
the Document to the public.

A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements".


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
documents released under this License, and replace the individual
copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

11. RELICENSING

"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site
means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in
part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or
in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and
(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
    Free Documentation License".

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
